Registrar.gov: Bug Bounty Program,https://bugcrowd.com/registrar-dotgov,"


Verisign Responsible Disclosure Program Terms:
We appreciate security researchers who help us keep Verisign employees and systems secure by reporting vulnerabilities in our services or infrastructure. Researchers who report such vulnerabilities may receive monetary bounties subject to the terms and conditions outlined below. To qualify for a bounty, researchers must meet the following requirements:

You must adhere to our Responsible Disclosure Policy (see below). 
Your report must address one of the in-scope Targets listed under “Bug Bounty Program Scope"" and must identify an eligible vulnerability (see below).
We specifically exclude certain targets as out-of-scope and certain security issues as ineligible (see below). 
You should provide sufficient proof of the vulnerability, such as a written description of the vulnerability or a screenshot demonstrating its existence. 
You agree to convey any and all intellectual property rights arising from or relating to each vulnerability you provide under Verisign's Program Brief. 
If you inadvertently access account data, service configurations, or other confidential information (collectively “Data"") while investigating an issue, you are prohibited from saving, storing, transferring or otherwise further accessing any and all such Data after discovery.

In turn, we follow these guidelines when evaluating reports under our bug bounty program:

We investigate all reports and respond to all reports relating to in-scope targets and eligible vulnerabilities. Due to the volume of reports we receive, we prioritize evaluations based on risk and other factors, and it may take some time before you receive a reply. 
We determine bounty amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation, and quality of the report. You can find further information in our Rewards Guidelines below. 
We generally pay similar amounts for similar issues, but bounty amounts and qualifying issues may change over time. Past rewards do not necessarily guarantee similar results in the future. 
In the event of duplicate reports addressing the same vulnerability, we award a bounty to the first person to report an issue with sufficient proof.
We reserve the right to publish reports (and accompanying updates). 
We may post a list of researchers who have submitted valid security reports. If you receive a bounty for discovery of a vulnerability, you are eligible to be included in this list, but you may opt not to be included if you wish. We reserve the right to limit or modify the information accompanying your name in the list. 
[Bugcrowd] verifies that all bounty awards are permitted by applicable laws, including (but not limited to) US trade sanctions and economic restrictions.
Verisign employees and their immediate family are not eligible to participate. 

Verisign Responsible Disclosure Policy:
Verisign expressly authorizes researching and reporting security issues in a manner that complies with the policies below, and, Verisign will not initiate a lawsuit against you or seek any law enforcement investigation against you in response to such authorized research and reports. We require that:

You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others. You specifically should avoid unauthorized access to, or destruction of, data and interruption or degradation of our services.
You do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason. Impermissible exploitation includes, but is not limited to, actions intended to demonstrate the potential impact or risk of the vulnerability, such as attempts to compromise sensitive company data or probing for additional issues related to an eligible vulnerability in an in-scope target that exceeds any of the policies addressed here. 
You do not intentionally violate any applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized access to data.

You are not authorized to access user data or company data, including (but not limited to) personally identifiable information or other data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. If you inadvertently access personal or company data while investigating an issue, you are prohibited from saving, storing, transferring or otherwise further accessing any and all such data after discovery.
Bug Bounty Program Scope:
Below is a list of in-scope and out-of-scope servers and websites, and a list of eligible and ineligible vulnerabilities to help guide your research. If you are unsure whether a service or vulnerability will qualify you for a bounty or not, feel free to ask support@bugcrowd.com.

ThousandEyes Bug Bounty,https://bugcrowd.com/thousandeyes-og,"


The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. ThousandEyes gives organizations visibility into the now borderless network, arming them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users, and customers.

This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritization/rating of findings.
Guidelines:

Please note that this is a live, production environment.
Automated vulnerability scans are strictly prohibited (this includes any kind of brute-force enumeration).
Keep information about any vulnerabilities you have discovered confidential between yourself and ThousandEyes. Any disclosure without prior approval is grounds for removal from the program, and forfeiture of any reward.
You must ensure that service operation and integrity and confidentiality of customer data are not affected in any way as a result of your testing. Any form of Denial of Service testing is strictly prohibited. If you believe you have identified a vector by which DoS can be performed, please reach out to USSR@thousandeyes.com.
This is a Private Program, so you must not discuss program details including Program name, scope, Vulnerability details, bounty structure, account information, or any other detail to anyone who is not a Bugcrowd employee or member of this program. When collaborating with other Finders on the Program, be sure to do so in a secure manner, in accordance with disclosure requirements listed in Bugcrowd’s Code of Conduct.
Please ensure that the string “Bugcrowd-<BugcrowdUsername>” is appended to your user agent for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic before performing any testing. Example instructions on how to modify the user agent string for Chrome can be found here and for Burp Suite can be found here.

 -Coinbase Custody


2.Once your ICP wallet address is ready, reply to this email and send the email address you plan to associate your account with before starting the KYC process. The provided email address will be whitelisted on the KYC website (~3 working days).
3.You will receive an email notification once your email has been whitelisted. Submit your KYC application on the KYC DFINITY page by clicking on ‘Other’ and entering the email address you provided to receive a unique link to begin the verification process. The KYC will be performed by a 3rd party and all information that the DFINITY Foundation receives is the email address and the ICP address.  
Make sure at every stage of the onboarding process that your wallet address and associated email address are entered correctly to avoid any delay. As a reminder, DFINITY is not responsible for your asset custody nor will it be held accountable for any loss of your ICP distributed to you in the ICP wallet address you have provided.

CyberGhost,https://bugcrowd.com/cyberghost,"


CyberGhost operates thousands of VPN servers and makes cross-platform VPN applications for all major desktop and mobile operating systems as well as routers and browser extensions.
CyberGhost takes the security of its applications and services seriously. We've offered an in-house bug bounty program for years and paid out thousands of dollars to security researchers in that time. We value excellent engineering and are always looking for ways to improve the security of our products and services.
Scope
Please ensure that your activities remain in-scope to the program. For example, admin panels for data center services we utilize are out of scope because they are not owned, hosted, and operated by CyberGhost. If you are unsure if your testing is considered in-scope please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com to confirm first. A researcher found to be testing out of scope will be ineligible for a reward and we will reserve the right to immediately remove the individual from the program.
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
We will review coordinated disclosures on a case by case basis. However, please note that we will automatically reject any findings that are marked as duplicates or not applicable. Please do not submit a disclosure request if your submission fits into these categories.

You Need a Budget (YNAB),https://bugcrowd.com/ynab,"


We work hard to keep You Need a Budget secure, and make every effort to keep on top of the latest threats by working with security researchers and companies. If you think we've made a security mistake or have a vulnerability, please tell us right away. If you're the first to alert us and it leads to us making a change, we'll pay you a reward.
Our Philosophy:

We're on your side! We both want you to find bugs in our application before any bad guys do.
Please be a hacker, but don't be a jerk. We'll get into more examples later, but that means: Hack your own accounts, not someone else's accounts. Don't perform DoS or DDoS attacks. Don't try to break into our physical offices or do anything illegal. Don't waste our time. This program is an invitation to test our systems. It's not an invitation to be a bad person.

What we hope you find:
(Actually, we hope you can't find any of this, but you know what we mean.)
The objective is to discover vulnerabilities in our web application and API.
Of particular interest are:

Bugs that Allow reading or writing of another user's data
XSS bugs
Bugs that Leak Sensitive information between sessions
Issues that affect Authentication or Session Management
Anything else classified P1-P3 really gets our attention!

How we classify submissions:
We classify all submissions based on Bugcrowds Vulnerability Taxonomy. P1s are scary, and we pay the maximum for those. On the other hand, P5s are considered ""recommended practices"", and we intentionally don't follow all recommendations. However, if you submit a P5 and we change our code as a result of your submission, it will be bumped to a P4, and paid out accordingly. 
Note: Please don't pretend your issue is more severe than it is when describing it. It will lead to lost trust and higher frustration, but it never leads to higher payouts!

"Tyler Technologies Data & Insights – Tyler Data Platform, powered by Socrata",https://bugcrowd.com/tyler-tech-data-insights,"


Tyler Technologies Data & Insights helps public sector organizations improve transparency, citizen service, and data-driven decision-making. Our user-friendly solutions deliver data to governments trying to reduce costs, to citizens who want to understand how their tax dollars are used, and to civic hackers dedicated to creating new apps and improving services.
We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security researcher community. The disclosure of security vulnerabilities by security researchers helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users and makes the Web a safer place for all.
Because our platform is built for data sharing it is worthwhile for researchers to familiarize themselves with the account permission models in place and especially with our Socrata Query Language (SoQL).

Guidelines

We strictly prohibit usage of Automated scanners - we have our own DAST :)
All testing should be limited to 0700-1800 PDT (GMT -7) - this helps our on-call staff stay sane :)
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing
Perform research only within the scope set out below
Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us
Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Socrata

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us we commit to:

Not institute a civil legal action against you and not support a criminal investigation
Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (confirming the report within one week of submission)
Recognize your contribution on our Security Researcher Hall of Fame, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue
Thank you for participating and happy hunting!


Rewards
To be eligible for a reward, your submission must include clear reproduction steps and provide details around exploitability and impact.  Including screenshots or providing a video is helpful as well.

Redox,https://bugcrowd.com/redox,"


Healthcare integration between critical and innovative software applications hurt healthcare experiences in the United States every day. Estimates are that there is over $750 billion wasted in healthcare each year. Redox aims to become one of the most trusted brands in healthcare. With your help, we will surpass HIPAA industry regulation guidelines and cater to all patients supremely.
The Redox platform provides a highly-scalable solution that eliminates technical barriers. From getting HL7 data over VPNs to a multitude of EHR(electronic health record) vendor APIs and even XML over SFTP, we need to do it all and do it securely.
Changelog:
New updates can be found here:
https://www.redoxengine.com/blog/category/redox/changelog/
Documentation:
We encourage researchers to review our Docs to learn about how more of our apis and platform work.
These resources in particular will help you get up to speed as quickly as possible:

Quickstart Video Tutorial
Get Up and Running with the Redox API in 15 minutes

IMPORTANT:


Please ensure you utilize your @bugcrowdninja.com email domain when creating accounts.  This helps us know that are researcher, not a malicious user

Additional accounts can be created via creating email aliases, such as tester@bugcrowdninja.com and tester+1@bugcrowdninja.com



Please make sure you are being as detailed as possible on your reports. 
Please make sure you are testing only in-scope targets (DO NOT TEST https://dashboard.redoxengine.com), REFER CAREFULLY TO IN SCOPE AND OUT OF SCOPE TARGETS BELOW.

Do not test contact forms on https://www.redoxengine.com.  Findings here will be considered out of scope

Don't Utilize Automated Scanning:
Redox runs automated scans from Acunetix, Zap, Nessus, et al., against the in-scope targets – so using these tools is likely of minimal utility to researchers. As such, please avoid using them unless for targeted, specific testing, and then only at less than six requests per second / less than 50 automated requests on a single endpoint. Custom scripts and fuzzing tools are still permitted, but if using them, please keep your traffic to six requests per second or less.
Report Criteria Must Include

Business Impact (how does this affect Redox?)
Steps to reproduce
Working proof of concept POC videos are required for validating any findings, as doing so will help expedite the triage process.
Discoverability (how likely is this to be discovered)
Exploitability (how likely is this to be exploited) 


Our Maximum Reward
Redox is offering a maximum reward (shown above) which is higher than our standard P1 reward for any Extraordinary Submissions. This means more than simply qualifying for a P1 under the VRT (which this bug should in terms of impact). It means the researcher has spent the time and effort to understand our platform and identified a flaw unique to our platform that most others would not find without such investment. Additionally, we'd expect the submission write up to reflect an understanding of the platform and can describe the vulnerability and its impact and how to resolve it clearly and concisely.
We will make an effort to respond as fast as possible to all submissions.

We require that all researchers:

  Do not access customer or employee personal information, pre-release Netflix content, or Netflix confidential information. If you accidentally access any of these, please stop testing and submit the vulnerability.
  Stop testing and report the issue immediately if you gain access to any non-public application or non-public credentials.
  Do not degrade the Netflix user experience, disrupt production systems, or destroy data during security testing.
  Perform research only within the scope set out below.
  Use the Bugcrowd report submission form to report vulnerability information to us.
  Collect only the information necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
  Submit any necessary screenshots, screen captures, network requests, reproduction steps or similar using the Bugcrowd submission form (do not use third party file sharing sites). 
  When investigating a vulnerability, please only target your own account and do not attempt to access data from anyone else’s account.
Securely delete Netflix information that may have been downloaded, cached, or otherwise stored on the systems used to perform the research.

If you fulfill these requirements, Netflix will:

  Work with you to understand and attempt to resolve the issue quickly (confirming the report within 7 days of submission)
  Recognize your contribution to our Security Researcher Hall of Fame, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.
  Pay you for your research for unique vulnerabilities that meet the guidelines listed below if you are the first to report the issue to us using the Bugcrowd portal.

To encourage responsible disclosure, Netflix will not bring a lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you if we determine that your research and disclosure meets these requirements and guidelines. If you have questions about responsible disclosure of results for a submission, please reach out to us via the submission page. 
If you have any questions regarding the Netflix program, please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com. 
Reward Guidelines

Netflix wishes to incentivize broad, information-rich vulnerability submissions to our program, particularly for the Targets we have listed. Please note that Netflix generally only issues a reward if we pursue a change based on the researcher submission, and we retain the sole discretion to reward any such submission even if it relates to a target that isn’t listed below. For certain vulnerabilities which may be present in different parts of a web application or view, Netflix may provide, at its discretion, an additional reward for those reports which detail multiple vectors for injections, XSS, or similar. This reward is in addition to the award ranges detailed below.

Blue Jeans Network,https://bugcrowd.com/bluejeans,"


BlueJeans takes the security, integrity, availability of the service, and the privacy of our users seriously. We appreciate all security concerns brought forth and are constantly striving to keep on top of the latest threats. Being proactive rather than reactive to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at BlueJeans. Every day new security issues and attack vectors are created. BlueJeans strives to keep abreast of the latest state-of-the-art security developments by working with security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure world.
Rules of engagement:
We are interested in hearing about security issues in production BlueJeans sites and our client software applications. These in-scope, production assets have been listed below under 'Targets'. That said, there are some things we explicitly ask you not to do:

Do not run automated scans without checking with us first. They are often very noisy.


If running any automated testing tools, be sure to keep well under 100 requests per second - otherwise you're likely to get locked out.


Do not test the physical security of BlueJeans offices, employees, equipment, etc.
Do not test using social engineering techniques (phishing, vishing, etc.)
Do not perform DoS or DDoS attacks.
In any way attack our end users, or engage in the trade of stolen user credentials.
In any way disrupt our customers

Atlassian-Built Apps,https://bugcrowd.com/atlassianapps,"


This bounty is part of the Atlassian Marketplace Bounty Program
The Atlassian Marketplace is a one-stop shop for apps that custom fit Atlassian products to the unique needs of every team. In this bounty program we are focused on the security of the Marketplace apps created and developed by Atlassian.
Please note that this program encompasses only the official Atlassian developed Marketplace apps and apps made by Trello. Vulnerabilities discovered in Atlassian products or services should be reported to the main Atlassian program. 
Vulnerabilities discovered in third party Marketplace apps (apps not developed by Atlassian) can be reported and we will forward such reports to the creators of the app or we will invite you to the app vendors bug bounty program if they have one, but we may not guarantee the eligibility for a reward. 
Note: Atlassian's Bugcrowd Landing Page provides a list of accessible vendor bug bounty programs to which you can directly report your third party app findings.
Get Started (tl;dr version)

Do not access, impact, destroy or otherwise negatively affect Atlassian customers, or customer data in any way.
Ensure that you use your @bugcrowdninja.com email address.
Ensure you understand the targets, scopes, exclusions, and rules below.
Information about how Atlassian apps work can be found here


Focus Areas
Due to the collaborative nature of Atlassian products, we are not interested in vulnerabilities surrounding enumeration and information gathering (being able to work effectively as a team is the purpose of our products). Instead, we're more interested in traditional web application vulnerabilities, as well as other vulnerabilities that can have a direct impact to our products. Below is a list of some of the vulnerability classes that we are seeking reports for:

Cross Instance Data Leakage/Access**
Server-side Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Stored/Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
SQL Injection (SQLi)
XML External Entity Attacks (XXE)
Access Control Vulnerabilities (Insecure Direct Object Reference issues, etc)
Path/Directory Traversal Issues
Connect App Authorization Bypass
Shared Secret Leakage

Ensure you review the out of scope and exclusions list for further details.
** Cross Instance Data Leakage/Access refers to unauthorized data access between instances. 
Note: Please ensure you're being non-destructive whilst testing and are only testing using accounts and instances created via the instructions under ""Creating your instance"". Any testing/spamming live Atlassian support portals or Marketplace sites will disqualify you and you will be banned from Atlassian programs.
Rewards
Any finding that is not listed as in scope can still be reported via this program. These reports will be rewarded at the discretion of the Atlassian Security Team.
Note: Atlassian uses CVSS to consistently score security vulnerabilities. Where discrepancies between the VRT and CVSS score exist, Atlassian will defer to the CVSS score to determine the priority.

code or configuration change based on the issue.
If at any time you are concerned or uncertain about testing in a way that is consistent with
the Guidelines and Scope of this policy, please contact us before proceeding.
To encourage good-faith security testing and disclosure of discovered vulnerabilities, we ask
that you:
Avoid violating privacy, harming user experience, disrupting production or corporate systems,
and/or destroying data,
Perform research only within the scope set out below, and respect systems and activities
which are out-of-scope,
Contact us immediately if you encounter any user data during testing,
Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us and,
Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential until we’ve resolved
them.


Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd
Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy.
However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due
to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed
explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make
a case for a higher priority.

Note: To unwrap and display Vault <> Server communication on the Web Vault, open the developer tools and type:
enableNetworkLog()

The Vulnerability Disclosure Program allows ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities but it does not provide monetary compensation. Endurance reserves the right to accept or reject any submission.

Eligibility
You may not participate in this program if you are an employee or family member of an employee, or a current vendor or employee of such vendor, of Endurance of any of its subsidiaries. [You are also prohibited from participating if you are (i) in a country or territory that is the target of U.S. sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, or the Crimea region of Ukraine), (ii) designated as a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control or otherwise owned, controlled, or acting on behalf of such a person or entity, or (iii) otherwise a prohibited party under U.S. trade and export control laws.]  
Ratings:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.

Program Rules

All valid reports will be taken seriously by our teams and with this in mind, do give us a reasonable period of time to evaluate the submission and respond accordingly.
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue may not be marked as triaged.
Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
When duplicates occur, we only triage the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be treated as one valid report.
While testing our systems you make every effort not to damage or restrict the availability of products, services or infrastructure.
You do not use a detected vulnerability to obtain more data than necessary for proving the vulnerability.
You agree to securely delete all personal and confidential information obtained during testing.

Service NSW Vulnerability Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/service-nsw-vdp,"


Our approach to vulnerability disclosure
Service NSW deeply values the positive impact security researchers have on our ability to provide safe and secure services to our customers.
We employ a bug bounty program through our partnership with Bugcrowd, and we gratefully accept any vulnerability disclosure reports. 

Our commitment to researchers
• Trust. We maintain complete confidentiality in our professional exchanges with researchers. 
• Respect. We treat all researchers with respect and recognise your positive contribution to helping keep our customers safe. 
• Transparency. We will openly work with researchers to validate and remediate reported vulnerabilities in accordance with our commitments to security and privacy. 
• Common good. We investigate and remediate issues in a manner consistent with protecting the safety and security of those potentially affected by a reported vulnerability. 
Our ask of researchers
• Trust. We ask that researchers communicate potential vulnerabilities with us in a responsible manner, providing us sufficient time and information to validate and address any potential issues. 
• Respect. We request that researchers make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data during security testing. 
• Transparency. We request that researchers provide the technical details and background necessary for our team to identify and validate the reported issues. 
• Common good. We request that researchers act for the common good, protecting user privacy and security by refraining from publicly disclosing unverified vulnerabilities until our team has had time to validate and address the reported issues.
We encourage you to submit details of suspected vulnerabilities across any asset owned, controlled, operated or maintained by Service NSW, including public-facing websites under the service.nsw.gov.au domain or the Service NSW mobile application. 
Please note that Service NSW cannot accept vulnerability reports on behalf of other NSW Government departments or agencies related to assets owned by other departments or agencies.  
The Service NSW Security team will acknowledge receipt of each vulnerability report, conduct a thorough investigation, and then take appropriate action for resolution. We will keep you informed throughout the process.

Stryker,https://bugcrowd.com/stryker-vdp,"


No technology is perfect and Stryker believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. We are excited for you to participate as a security researcher to help us identify vulnerabilities in our products. Good luck, and happy hunting!

Important information:
We will not engage in legal action against individuals who submit reports through our Vulnerability Reporting process and enter into a legal agreement with us. We agree to work with individuals who:    

Engage in testing of systems/research without harming Stryker or its customers.

Perform tests on products without affecting customers, or receive permission/consent from customers before engaging in vulnerability testing against their devices/software, etc.

Engage in vulnerability testing within the scope of our vulnerability disclosure program in accordance with the terms and conditions of any agreements entered into between Stryker and individuals.
Adhere to the laws of their location and the location of Stryker. For example, violating laws that would only result in a claim by Stryker (and not a criminal claim) may be acceptable as Stryker is authorizing the activity (reverse engineering or circumventing protective measures) to improve its system.
Refrain from disclosing vulnerability details before any mutually agreed-upon timeframe expires.

Preference, prioritization, and acceptance criteria
We will use the following criteria to prioritize and triage submissions.
What we would like to see from you:

Reports written in English.

Reports that include proof‐of‐concept code, which will better equip us to triage.

How you found the vulnerability, the impact, and any potential remediation.


Note: Reports that include only crash dumps or other automated tool output may receive lower priority.
What you can expect from us:

A timely response to your email (within 5 business days).
We will direct the potential findings to the appropriate product teams for verification and reproduction. You may be contacted to provide additional information at this stage.

We will, following investigation of a report, confirm the existence of the vulnerability and the potential impact.  - If the identified vulnerability is determined to impact patient safety, we will work expeditiously to develop a resolution and take appropriate action. All other vulnerabilities will be evaluated and addressed based upon the associated risk.
An open dialog to discuss issues.

Notification when the vulnerability analysis has completed each stage of our review.

Credit after the vulnerability has been validated and resolved, if desired.

We are committed to being as transparent as possible about the remediation timeline and issues or challenges that may be involved.

If we are unable to resolve communication issues or other problems, we may bring in a neutral third party (such as CERT/CC, ICS-CERT, or the relevant regulator) to assist in determining how best to handle the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice, as well as for case-by-case exceptions. No particular level of response is guaranteed.

Notice:
In the event, you decide to share any information with Stryker, you agree that the information you submit will be considered as non-proprietary and non-confidential and that Stryker is allowed to use such information in any manner, in whole or in part, without any restriction. Furthermore, you agree that submitting information does not create any rights for you or any obligation for Stryker.

SEEK ,https://bugcrowd.com/seek,"


For this program, we're inviting researchers to test SEEK's web applications and services - with a focus of identifying security weaknesses that might lead to the compromise of our customer data (mainly, job seekers profiles and resumes).
Thank you for participating!
A Few Important Requirements for SEEK:

Denial of Service, Rate Limiting, and other automated attacks are not allowed. Please do NOT use automated tooling when conducting testing on SEEK assets.
All testing must be conducted using your @bugcrowdninja.com email ID only. If you fail to use your @Bugcrowdninja.com email ID, you run the risk of getting blocked from accessing SEEK applications.
Customer instances are not to be accessed in any way (i.e. no customer data is accessed, customer credentials are not to be used or ""verified"")


If you believe you have found sensitive customer data (e.g., login credentials, API keys etc) or a way to access customer data (i.e. through a vulnerability) report it, but do not attempt to successfully validate if/that it works.



Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood and impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, SEEK will provide a reasonable justification to the researcher.
To maximize your reward and payout time frame, please make sure to include the following in your report:


An attack scenario: What is the most likely way an attacker could abuse this vulnerability?

Clear reproduction steps: If we can't easily replicate what you are describing, we may not consider the issue as serious.

Recommended fix: If you have any good ideas on ways to mitigate the risk without impacting normal users, your submission will have more value.

Triage SLA
For P1/P2 issues, we aim to complete our triage within one business week of the issue being reported. For other issues, it may take us up to three business weeks to triage the issue.

We will also leverage CVSS ratings if there is any ambiguity in where the submission falls in the VRT to help maintain the severity and impact of the finding. CVSS generally tracks with the VRT as such:



Severity Level
Critical
High
Medium
Low
Informational




VRT
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5


CVSS v3
10.0-9.0
8.9-7.0
6.9-4.0
<= 3.9 Low Impact
<= 3.9 Informational



Note that we will not pay for submissions that count as Informational/P5.
We reserve the right to make any final determination of rating levels for any reported vulnerability. 
Out-of-Scope
Note that the scope of the program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in our software and websites only.  Social engineering attempts or any other attacks in the physical world are out of scope.
The Bullish websites are out of scope and are covered under a separate program which can be found here.
Qualifying Vulnerabilities

To qualify for bounty, the security bug must be original and previously unreported, and must be reported to us and only us.
We reserve the right to consider vulnerabilities in third party software as being in or out of scope.
We will consider those vulnerabilities as in scope if they meet the other requirements for originality and are not covered by another bug bounty program.
We will work with researchers to coordinate reports with third party programs.
Any reward for third party vulnerabilities will require engagement with requirements of the third party software including responsible disclosure.
Public disclosure of third party vulnerabilities even through recognized programs prior to a report to us will disqualify a report for a bounty.
Regardless of timing and eligibility for reward, we will still work to provide mitigation, disclosure and recognition as part of this program for third party researchers.

Non-Qualifying Vulnerabilities
General Out of Scope Items

Denial Of Service 
Out of concern for the availability of our services to all users, please do not attempt to carry out DoS attacks against public or 3rd parties, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam people, or engage in other behavior of a similar nature or with similar consequences.
URL redirection 
We recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in modern browsers; consequently, we hold that the usability and security benefits of a small number of well ­designed and closely monitored redirectors outweigh their true risks.
Phishing Websites 
We welcome reports of phishing websites using any marks, brands or similar identity to any our assets. However, we cannot pay bounties on such reports so as to avoid any creation of incentives for such efforts.
Flaws affecting the users of out ­of­ date systems. 
The security models of the web, software and blockchain are being constantly fine­-tuned. We will not typically reward any problems that affect only the users of outdated or unpatched systems.
""Coin Scams"" 
There are always scams present attempting to misappropriate real money, crypto currency and personal information. Except where such efforts infringe on a legally protected mark or identity We have no ability to intervene and therefore cannot pay bounties on such reports.

Third Party Assets - Additional Out of Scope Items

Third party software except as previously noted.
Public blockchains by third parties will always be out of scope.

The above being said, if you find outdated software and have good reasons to suspect that it poses a well defined security risk, please let us know. If you find security issues with third party public blockchain resources, block producers, etc. and are unable to establish contact directly we will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in establishing contact.
Staying out of Trouble
Violations of these requirements may result in us finding a researcher ineligible for a reward and/or disqualifying any such researcher for participation in the current program or any future programs. We may also disqualify a researcher for Safe Harbor under these program rules as well as local laws and regulations.

Please do not try to gain access into our offices, attempt social engineering attacks against our employees, etc.
Please, never attempt to access anyone else's data and do not engage in any activity that would be disruptive or damaging to users or to us.
Do not engage in any activity that is classed as illegal.
Do not use vulnerability testing tools that automatically generate significant volumes of traffic that could lead to the degradation of our systems or network.

Other rules

You represent and warrant that all submissions of vulnerability made by you are your own work, that you have not used information owned by another person or entity, and that you have the legal right to provide the submission of vulnerability in this program to us or Bugcrowd.

Special Bonus
Up to $5000


Personal information leakage
Up to $5000



Report Assessment and Bounty Calculations
1) Base Bounty Maximum reward is based on the bounty table. The report is then evaluated based on maximum reward, CVSS and an evaluation of the business impact.
2) Other rewards: Personal information leakage (PII) We aim to follow the below when awarding bounties, but the following should be considered a guideline and exceptions may apply.

Category A – Max $5000:


Financially sensitive data (Example: Credit card details, incl. either CVC/CVV number and/or full card number)
Biometric data (Example: Fingerprint features used for authentication)
Official documents used for identification (Example: Passport)
Any information covered by Personal Information Protection law (Example: Information that allows one to uniquely identifying a person)


Category B – Max $2000:


Partially identifying information (Example: Full address incl. apartment number, if applicable)
Information not supposed to be available to the attacker (Example: Account Amount and Transaction History)


Category C – Max $1000:


Other types of sensitive user information (Example: Full name, List of previous purchases)



3) Other rewards: Special Bonus This category is for rewarding special contributions. This is entirely up to the WOO Network Bug Bounty team’s discretion, but the goal is to reward reports we consider exceptional. Reports that qualify based on the below will have their bounty increased up to $5,000.
A few examples of things we will be looking for are:

Novel and innovative approach and exploit 
Creative chaining of exploits 
Easy to understand report and good description root cause of issue
Vulnerabilities that could undermine the safety of any user or validator's fund/fee
Vulnerabilities related to key generation, encryption, decryption, signing and verification
Remote leaks of unencrypted private keys / mnemonic / key seed
Vulnerabilities that could severely undermine trading or token economy.

Examples of issues that we are looking for:

Vulnerabilities that can cause a loss of user funds/assets remotely
Vulnerabilities that can cause exposure of private keys or mnemonic seed phrase remotely
Vulnerabilities in chain-related implementations
Denial of service of the wallet app
Remote code execution
Insecure cryptographic implementation for sensitive functions such as wallet generation, transaction signing etc.


Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as in scope. Any domain/property of WOO Network} not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains not listed above. If you happen to identify a security vulnerability on a target that is not in scope, but it demonstrably belongs to WOO Network, you can report it to this program. However, be aware that it is ineligible for rewards or points-based compensation.

 1Password,https://bugcrowd.com/agilebits,"


Program details
Thanks for your interest in the 1Password bug bounty program! We're happy you're here.
Our goal is to make 1Password as secure as possible and we see that ongoing process as a team effort. External security evaluations are an important part of the process and make 1Password a better, safer product. We need researchers who can think creatively, and work 'outside the box', to find security bugs.
We use scope to point people to what we want tested. Out of scope targets can receive rewards, but they are at our discretion.
This is not an easy program. For example, running scanners is unlikely to help you here, and standard XSS-type injections won't yield much either. But we want to help.
Doing our part
1Password is committed to helping you succeed in this program, so we've set up a researcher vault with additional helpful information. To receive an invitation to the vault, opt in by emailing support+bugcrowd@agilebits.com with your Bugcrowd username; you'll be provisioned account access to the 1Password vault where we provide supplemental information for testing. This includes documentation on real issues that were recently found (which may provide direction toward more issues) and more.
We also accept bug bounty submissions on other accounts, such as your own active 1Password account or trial accounts you made.
If you believe you've found something close to exploitation, but aren't quite there yet, we are happy to answer any questions you have that could help you further your theory. Note that some requests may not be answered unless documentation already exists, depending on the complexity. In other words, we'll make a good faith effort to help you, but understand that complex or very time-consuming requests do not come with any guarantee of help.
Where to start
Our white paper is your guide. It explains our security decisions and several considerations. At the very least, please read the Beware of the Leopard section near the end.
1Password.com uses security mechanisms that make it hard to analyze with standard tools like Burp. Therefore we have a tool that helps you investigating 1Password.com requests and responses with your own session key here: https://github.com/1Password/burp-1password-session-analyzer
$1 Million Reward - Capture the Flag
The 'flag' you're after is a note in the white box testing account that contains bad poetry. But our version of Capture the Flag is unlike others. There are no known vulnerabilities that will award you access to the bad poetry; there is no starting point, and it's not a game with a guaranteed reward.
Phishing, malware, and anything that involves tricking or compromising a 1Password member's account are not allowed.
We are happy to answer general questions and to help you understand 1Password, but we will not provide any direct assistance to assist with capturing the 'flag'.
A valid submission detailing the steps used to Capture the Flag is the only way to earn the $1 million reward.
We want to hear from you
We love feedback about our bug bounty program and documentation; we appreciate any comments about how we might improve our approach.
Please note: This is NOT an easy web target (for instance, running scanners is unlikely to help you here, and standard XSS-type injections won't yield much either). That said, 1Password is committed to helping you succeed on this program. To this end, they've setup a researcher vault with additional, helpful information, that requires you opt-in to receive an invite. You can opt-in by emailing support+bugcrowd@agilebits.com with your Bugcrowd username, and you'll be provisioned account access to the vault where 1Password provides supplemental information for testing against the application - including documentation on real issues that were recently found (so as to give direction towards where more issues may be present) and more.

Railroad Retirement Board - Vulnerability Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/rrb-vdp,"


Introduction
As part of a U.S. government agency, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) takes seriously our responsibility to protect the railroad public's information, including financial and personal information, from unwarranted disclosure.  A part of this responsibility is allowing security researchers to seek vulnerabilities in the RRB’s systems that support the mission of the agency.
We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they've discovered, as set out in this policy, so that we can fix them and keep our information safe.
This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

Guidelines
We require that you:
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to ""pivot"" to other systems. Once you've established that a vulnerability exists, or encountered any of the sensitive data outlined below, you must stop your test and notify us immediately.
Keep confidential any information about discovered vulnerabilities for up to 90 calendar days after you have notified RRB.

Legal
You must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws in connection with your security research activities or other participation in this vulnerability disclosure program.
RRB does not authorize, permit, or otherwise allow (expressly or impliedly) any person, including any individual, group of individuals, consortium, partnership, or any other business or legal entity to engage in any security research or vulnerability or threat disclosure activity that is inconsistent with this policy or the law. If you engage in any activities that are inconsistent with this policy or the law, you may be subject to criminal and/or civil liabilities.
To the extent that any security research or vulnerability disclosure activity involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a non-RRB entity (e.g., other Federal departments or agencies; State, local, or tribal governments; private sector companies or persons; employees or personnel of any such entities; or any other such third party), that non-RRB third party may independently determine whether to pursue legal action or remedies related to such activities.
If you conduct your security research and vulnerability disclosure activities in accordance with the restrictions and guidelines set forth in this policy, (1) RRB will not initiate or recommend any law enforcement or civil lawsuits related to such activities, and (2) in the event of any law enforcement or civil action brought by anyone other than RRB, RRB will communicate as appropriate, in the absence of any legal restriction on RRB's ability to so communicate, that your activities were conducted pursuant to and in compliance with this policy.

We truly believe that this program plays a key role in protecting our customers and their data. We appreciate all security submissions and strive to respond in an expedient manner.

General Guidelines

Vulnerability reports which do not include careful manual validation - for example, reports based only on results from automated tools and scanners or which describe theoretical attack vectors without proof of exploitability - will be automatically closed as “Not Applicable”.
Verify your submission details, steps to reproduce and working proof of concept.
Collect only the information necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability. Do not conduct any escalation processes. Please report it “as is” and we will reward you with an appropriate bounty taking into full consideration the severity of what could be done. 
When investigating a vulnerability, please only target your own account and do not attempt to access data from anyone else’s account.

Reward Guidelines
We base all payouts on impact and will reward accordingly. Please emphasize the impact as part of your submission.
We are particularly interested and will consider extraordinary submissions for:

Major exposures around customer data leak
Issues that result in full compromise of a system (e.g, RCE, obtain a shell back from our network)
Business logic bypasses resulting in significant impact
Major operational failure (excluding Denial of Service related submissions)

We at Sportradar actively encourage anyone who believes they have discovered a vulnerability (or a “weakness” or an “issue” or a “bug”) in our systems to act immediately to help us improve and strengthen the safety of our systems by sharing
it with us.
We are thankful to you for taking the time to report to us the weaknesses that you discover if it is done so in adherence to the following responsible disclosure guidelines as stipulated under this Policy. Good luck, and happy hunting!
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be further modified in accordance with its likelihood to occur, at Sportradar’s own discretion. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to you.
Rules of Engagement

Do not intentionally access non-public Sportradar data any more than is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability. For example, 2 or 3 records is enough to demonstrate most vulnerabilities (such as an enumeration or direct object reference vulnerability) 
Do not permanently modify or delete Sportradar hosted data 
Do not DDoS or otherwise disrupt, interrupt or degrade our internal or external services 
Do not put a backdoor in the system, not even for the purpose of showing the vulnerability 
Do not share confidential information obtained from SportData - Social engineering is out of scope.

Do not send phishing emails to, or use other social engineering techniques against, anyone, including Sportradar staff, members, vendors, or partners 
Do not utilise any brute-force techniques (e.g. repeatedly entering passwords) in order to gain access to the system 
Do not attack, in any way, our end users, or engage in trade of stolen user credentials. However, should you become aware of such trade, we would certainly appreciate being informed 
Do not disclose any vulnerabilities in Sportradar systems/services to 3rd parties/the public prior to the Sportradar confirming that those vulnerabilities have been mitigated or rectified. 
For any issues reported; detail the type of issue, any versions or URL’s that are vulnerable to it, methods to reproduce the issue, as well as the impact and exploitability of it.
If reporting XSS issues (in particular) detail the browser type and version used, together with any other relevant information (URL, fields, input provided, etc.).
Identify HTTP requests used during testing only with a custom HTTP header with the format X-Security-Testing=email_address_at_domain.tld .\
Report acceptance and the determination of reported findings is at the sole discretion of Sportradar. This includes if, how and when any vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

Remediation policy
We aim to remediate reported vulnerabilities as soon as possible, with higher priority given to higher severity bugs reported. We aim to remediate all accepted reports within 90 days. If we do need more time to fix a reported bug, we will notify the security researcher. 
Disclosure of vulnerabilities is only accepted after the vulnerability has been remediated and the report has been closed by our security team. If this takes more than 90 days, the security researcher will be notified both of the delay, and when the vulnerability has been remediated.

ExpressVPN takes the security of its applications and services seriously. We've offered an in-house bug bounty program for years and paid out thousands of dollars to security researchers in that time. We value excellent engineering and are always looking for ways to improve the security of our products and services.

Special Bonuses and Rewards
TrustedServer — First Critical Finding Bonus
We have designed our ExpressVPN VPN servers to be secure and resilient. We even have an audited design called TrustedServer that dramatically improves the security posture of our servers. We’re confident in our work in this area and aim to ensure that our VPN servers meet our security expectations. 
As such, we’re inviting our researchers to focus testing on the following types of security issues within our VPN servers:

Unauthorized access to a VPN server or remote code execution
Vulnerabilities in our VPN server that result in leaking the real IP addresses of clients or the ability to monitor user traffic

In order to qualify to claim this bounty, we will require proof of impact to our user’s privacy. This will require demonstration of unauthorized access, remote code execution, IP address leakage or the ability to monitor unencrypted (non-VPN encrypted) user traffic.
To make this challenge more enticing, we are introducing the following bonus: the first person to submit a valid vulnerability will receive an additional $100,000 USD bonus bounty. This bonus will be valid until the prize has been claimed.
Scope
We use TrustedServer as a platform for all the protocols that we offer our users, so all our VPN servers are considered in scope. 
Please ensure that your activities remain in-scope to the program. For example, admin panels for data center services we utilize are out of scope because they are not owned, hosted, and operated by ExpressVPN. If you are unsure if your testing is considered in-scope please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com to confirm first. A researcher found to be testing out of scope will be ineligible for a reward and we will reserve the right to immediately remove the individual from the program.
Exclusions
We strive to ensure that our challenges are on a level playing field. Thus, the following individuals are not eligible to claim the bonus for the first critical finding:

Full-time or part-time employees of ExpressVPN or any other subsidiary of Kape Technologies, as well as their friends and family; and
Contractors, consultants, representatives, suppliers, vendors, or any other persons related to or otherwise affiliated with ExpressVPN.


Ratings/Rewards
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
We will review coordinated disclosures on a case by case basis. However, please note that we will automatically reject any findings that are marked as duplicates or not applicable. Please do not submit a disclosure request if your submission fits into these categories.

US Environmental Protection Agency Vulnerability Disclosure ,https://bugcrowd.com/epa-vdp,"


Introduction
EPA is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.
This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered – as described in this policy – so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We have developed this policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.
Authorization
If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and EPA will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.
Disclosure of vulnerabilities is completely voluntary.  In no case shall disclosure of vulnerability information to the EPA constitute a contractual or any other type of relationship with the EPA.  By submitting a vulnerability, the researcher acknowledges that, there is no expectation of payment for these services and waives any future payment claims against the U.S. Government related to the submission.  
Guidelines
We request that you:

Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.
Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence.

Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information,  proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.

Caffeine,https://bugcrowd.com/caffeine,"


Caffeine is a social broadcasting platform for gaming, entertainment, and the creative arts. Our goal with this bug bounty program is give researchers a responsible way to disclose vulnerabilities, allow us to build a more secure service for all our users, and reward you for your hard work.
For this program, we are inviting researchers to test our websites, mobile apps, API services, auxiliary services and our Windows 10 broadcasting software.

Requirements
Signup

Use an email address you actively monitor as this will be needed for account verification 
Prefix your username with the letter bcr_. 
You are welcome to test almost all of the components, and though it is not required, to start broadcasting yourself. To do so you will need at least 5Mbps upload and a supported game installed.

Behavioral Guidelines
Eligibility to participate in the program is contingent on your ability abide by the following  - inability to do so will result in disqualification from rewards and/or removal from the program.

Do not sign up with an @caffeine.tv email address!

Do Not Spam live broadcasts 

Do Not Create more than 5 test accounts


Do not attempt any tests on a broadcaster's live broadcast other than your own (www.caffeine.tv/yourusername)
 Do Not send messages to the API with the stage_id of any other person's stage.
You may ""ignore"" other users, but do not ""report"" any users or broadcasts.
In the Caffeine broadcasting software, there is a form to “Report an Issue”. Please do not test this more than once as it does go directly to our support team.
Please delete any accounts that you have created but do not intend to use anymore 

Modifications

Subdomain takeovers will be initially rated as a P4 and will be upgraded/downgraded by the client accordingly.


Tips for Testing
Access
Scanning is allowed, but keep in mind this is running on AWS who do actively block some scans.
Caffeine.tv runs automated scans from Acunetix, Zap, Nessus, et al., against the in-scope targets – so using these tools is likely of minimal utility to researchers. As such, please avoid using them unless for targeted, specific testing, and then only at less than six requests per second / less than 50 automated requests on a single endpoint.
Authentication
Caffeine uses an OAuth 2.0 style authentication system with a Request Token and an Access Token. Currently, Access Tokens expire after 15 minutes. 
Submissions related to the access token not immediately expiring will be considered ineligible for reward (such as changing of password or logout). 
If a researcher is able to demonstrate that the access token is valid for more than 15 minutes, that is likely to be viewed as a priority.
 Refresh Tokens will expire immediately upon changing password.

Focus Areas

Of particular importance is if you can determine the IP address of a broadcaster. We believe there is nothing exposing the broadcaster's IP address, so if you find a workaround, expect to be compensated well.
Given the website is statically hosted on S3, the attack surface is small. Instead, focus more on the APIs, particularly focusing on account takeover techniques.

NAB's Responsible Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/nationalaustraliabankog,"


Thank you for participating in NAB’s Responsible Disclosure Program. The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of NAB and our customers.
We continually strive to keep protecting our customers and colleagues through operational resilience while getting things done faster and delivering sustainable outcomes for our customer, colleagues, and the community. Working with Bugcrowd and security researchers fits in with our goals and strategy. After all, a more secure infrastructure means a more secure place for our customers to do their banking.
Reporting:

To make a disclosure you'll need to first Sign up with Bugcrowd  https://bugcrowd.com/user/sign_up or login to your existing account.
Please be aware NAB may not correspond with you directly, disclose remediation steps or timeframes.
No monetary disbursements for findings will be provided on this program.

Ratings:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher – along with the opportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority.
Guidelines: 
Targets on this program are from our Production environment, hence all testing needs to be performed in a production safe manner and all the following instructions should be strictly adhered to. If you have any questions around something being production safe or not please err on the side of caution and reach out to support@bugcrowd.com with any questions. 

If you discover other credentials during recon and testing, Do NOT use them for additional testing

Do NOT pursue post-exploitation or pivot from the vulnerable target into other parts of the network unless explicitly approved by NAB to do so especially in the following situations: 


The exploit will result in a permanent change to the target system and may impact the experience of other users (i.e. Stored Cross-Site Scripting)
The exploit has a high likelihood of impacting the availability of a service
The exploitation may result in sensitive NAB data (i.e. customer or financial information) being leaked


Scanning Activity Guidelines: to reduce the likelihood of production outages


For any enumeration activities, scanners should be limited to a maximum of 6 requests/second 
Recursive DNS enumeration should be minimized
NAB will not accept generic vulnerability scan results, as these are likely to be duplicated. 

Any scanning or brute force attempts on Submission Forms is considered Out-Of-Scope and should not be attempted. You may reach out for approval to do manual testing. 


Follow the AWS pentesting guidelines where applicable: https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/

Department of Labor,https://bugcrowd.com/dol-vdp,"


The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information from unauthorized disclosure. This policy is intended to provide security researchers with clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.
This policy describes:

What systems and types of research are covered under this policy;
How to send us vulnerability reports; and
How long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.

We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered – as set out in this policy – so that we can fix them and keep our users safe.  We have developed this policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.
Guidelines
We request that you:

Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command-line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to “pivot” to other systems.
Once you’ve found a vulnerability or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.
Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.
While it is encouraged to provide contact information, anonymous submissions are also accepted.

Authorization
Finders or researchers that comply with this policy and exercise an appropriate degree of care when performing vulnerability research will be considered authorized. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.

TripAdvisor Triage and Reporting

This program adheres to the BugCrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritisation/rating of findings.
This bounty follows BugCrowd’s standard disclosure terms.
Kudos points awarded will vary based on the priority of your submission. How We Measure Crowd Performance.
Reports should contain demonstrated practical impact. For example, subdomain takeover priority can be P5 as well as P1 depending on the data flowing through the subdomain. Make sure to answer the question ""What could an attacker do with submitted vulnerability"". For example, taking over a subdomain that is not used at all has no impact and will be considered P5.
Reports should include full HTTP requests and responses.
Final decisions on vulnerability priority and bounty amount are made by TripAdvisor security team for each report individually.

SpaceX/Starlink,https://bugcrowd.com/spacex,"


SpaceX produces rockets, provides launch services, and has developed Starlink - a SpaceX service for providing high speed internet via satellite. SpaceX welcomes researchers to test on their platform in a non-disruptive manner and submit findings as set forth below. SpaceX values the work done by security researchers in improving the security of our products and service offerings. We are committed to working with this community to verify, reproduce and respond to legitimate reported vulnerabilities. We encourage the community to participate in our responsible reporting process. Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as in scope (see the scope page).
Any domain/property of SpaceX not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains and IPs not listed as in scope. If you happen to identify a security vulnerability on a target that is not in scope, but it demonstrably belongs to SpaceX, you can report it as set forth below. However, be aware that it is ineligible for rewards or points-based compensation.

Starlink Target Information
While starlink.com is in scope (see scope section below for more details), we are not currently providing service, credentials, or hardware to researchers. However, researchers are free to test on equipment they own or any in-scope targets that they have access to. 
If you would like to participate in the Starlink program and purchase hardware, please sign up with a personal email address on starlink.com. Availability is dependent on location and desired class of service.
While we use Bugcrowd as a platform for rewarding all issues, please report issues in satellites, Starlink Dishes, or other hardware directly to vulnerabilityreporting@spacex.com, using our GPG key to encrypt reports containing sensitive information.

Researching Responsibly

As mentioned above, any testing that disrupts service to other users is considered out of scope.
Any physical attacks on infrastructure beyond what you physically own is out of scope. More specifically, you are welcome to test on your own Starlink Dish, but physical attacks against any larger scale infrastructure (such as ground stations that affect multiple users) are prohibited.
You are not permitted to chain exploits or perform post-exploitation activities on satellites or other critical infrastructure. If you think you have discovered an issue with a satellite (or are close to discovering one) stop immediately and report the finding.
You are expected to make a good faith disclosure to SpaceX with details of any findings.
We support the open publication of security research. We do ask that you give us a heads-up before any publication so we can do a final sync-up and check.

Do not engage in any sort of physical attacks on SpaceX/Starlink infrastructure or conduct testing which could interfere with its stability or ability to provide service. If you believe you've found an issue that affects a satellite or other highly sensitive system, please stop and email vulnerabilityreporting@spacex.com — we will work with you to safely complete a proof of concept.

Third-party bugs
If issues reported to our bug bounty program affect a third-party library, external project, or another vendor, SpaceX reserves the right to forward details of the issue to that third party without further discussion with the researcher. We will do our best to coordinate and communicate with researchers throughout this process. 

Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly correct any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you nor ask law enforcement to investigate you provided you comply with the following Responsible Disclosure Guidelines and other rules and guidelines of this program:

Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
Do not modify or access data that does not belong to you.
Give SpaceX a reasonable time to correct the issue before making any information public.
Do not abuse vulnerabilities, or exploit them beyond the extent necessary to create a proof-of-concept.


Safe Harbor
When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions to the extent that they would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please inquire via support@bugcrowd.com before going any further.

Rewards
We pay rewards ranging from $100 to $25,000. Rewards are administered according to the following guidelines (see scope tab for target details):
Web/network targets

RCE: Up to $10,000
SQLi: $500–$10,000
XSS: $100–$1,000
CSRF: $100–$500
Authentication bypass: Up to $10,000
Horizontal privilege escalation: $500-$3,000
Vertical privilege escalation: $500–$10,000

Starlink Dish, satellite, or other products

Case-by-case, up to $25,000 (report directly, see above). When triaging vulnerabilities, some of the factors we consider are:


Target (Dish, satellite, router, backend infrastructure, etc.)
Access required (physical, local network, authenticated, etc.)
Privileges gained on target
Persistence on target

iRobot,https://bugcrowd.com/irobot,"


NOTE! [Please Read Fully Before Beginning Or Engaging In Any Testing]

Please DO NOT use automated vulnerability scanners when testing against the in-scope targets (Zap/Burp/Acunetix/Nikto/Nessus/etc) - all of these tools have already been run, and are run on a recurring basis internally. Running any tools of this nature is largely an inefficient use of your time and resources.
However, you ARE encouraged to run any custom scripts or fuzzers that you have developed (e.g. niche file or directly wordlists, etc); however, please keep your requests using these tools to UNDER 50 requests per SECOND.
In short, we strongly encourage researchers to perform manual testing by hand - this is where you're much more likely to achieve success, and a much better use of your time and resources, as opposed to running common tools that have already been used extensively against the in-scope targets, etc.
Please be aware that Submissions found using pirated software will not be rewarded.
Good luck, and happy hunting!

Additionally, please be aware that this program does not accept out of scope submissions. Testing targets that are out of scope is strictly prohibited.

iRobot, the leading global consumer robot company, designs and builds robots that empower people to do more both inside and outside of the home. This program is testing iRobot's web applications, mobile applications, cloud APIs, and cloud-connected robots for vulnerabilities.

Department of Veterans Affairs,https://bugcrowd.com/va-vdp,"


Introduction
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is charged with providing health care and benefits to support Veterans and members of their families.
VA is committed to ensuring the integrity of its information by securing its information systems. A vulnerability is a “weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.” This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) is meant to address some of the possible apprehensions and explain what research would be authorized under this VDP. Good faith research that conforms to these guidelines is considered authorized research. The Department will focus on quickly working to resolve the vulnerability you have identified and is not interested in pursuing legal action when there is authorized research under this policy.
This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to report the vulnerability, how long VA asks security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities and what communication or response to expect from the Department.
The Department encourages security researchers to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in VA systems.
These Guidelines Require that You/a Researcher:

Access a VA information system in a way that follows this VDP.
If you discovered a vulnerability, reported it by following the instructions in this VDP.
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
Limit the use of discovered exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence.
Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command-line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to pivot to other systems.
Provide VA a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
Do not submit a high volume of low-quality vulnerability reports.

If you established that a vulnerability or security weakness exists or encounter any sensitive data or data belonging to individuals with their financial information, medical information, contract information or proprietary information which might be a trade secret, you must stop your test, notify VA immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.

Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
Introduction
The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information from unwarranted disclosure. This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us. This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities. We want security researchers to feel comfortable reporting vulnerabilities they’ve discovered – as set out in this policy – so we can fix them and keep our users safe. We have developed this policy to reflect our values and uphold our sense of responsibility to security researchers who share their expertise with us in good faith.
Guidelines
We request that you:

Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command-line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to “pivot” to other systems.
Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.
Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

Authorization
If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and ONHIR will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research.

Welcome
Our purpose is to refresh the world and make a difference, and we can’t do that without trust. Central to maintaining this trust is the protection of the information that we’ve been entrusted with by consumers, our customers and partners, and investors.  The Coca-Cola Company recognizes the positive contributions of security researchers and welcomes you to participate in our vulnerability disclosure program.
Ground Rules for Researchers

While use of automated scanning tools is not prohibited, our security operations team routinely blocks broad and persistent scanning activity.  You should limit the scope and frequency of any scanning to prevent this, we'd suggest no more than 5 requests per second.
Where possible, please include UA-Bugcrowd in your request header as the User-Agent value. 
 If you create an identity/account for the purposes of testing an in-scope target, please use your @bugcrowdninja.com email address.
While testing DoS attacks remains out of scope based on Bugcrowd's standard program terms, we further ask that you be mindful when testing DoS-related functions such as rate limiting of user actions.  If you choose to do do this, please keep your requests in the dozens, not in the hundreds or thousands, while also continuing to comply with the with the requests per second rules above.
Please avoid techniques/PoCs that are likely to cause alarms in security monitoring such as opening shells on remote servers.  Please coordinate with us in advance on these.

At United, we take your safety, security and privacy seriously. We utilize best practices and are confident that our systems are secure. We are committed to protecting our customers' privacy and the personal data we receive from them, which is why we offer a vulnerability disclosure program — the first of its kind within the airline industry. We believe that this program will further bolster our security and allow us to continue to provide excellent service. If you think you have discovered a potential vulnerability that affects our websites, apps and/or online portals, please let us know. If the submission meets our requirements, we'll gladly reward you for your time and effort.
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
The reward for disclosing an eligible vulnerability may vary depending on the severity of the vulnerability. The United Security team will determine the severity of the vulnerability after reviewing the submission, using a combination of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and OWASP Risk Rating Methodology. Researchers will be paid out upon successful validation of their submission.  Several submissions may be considered one vulnerability at United's discretion. 
Eligibility requirements
To ensure that submissions and payouts are fair and relevant, the researcher and the vulnerability must be eligible according the United disclosure program terms, including, but not limited to, the following requirements:

All vulnerabilities must be new discoveries. Award miles will be provided only to the first researcher who submits a particular vulnerability.
The researcher must be a MileagePlus® member in good standing of at least 18 years of age. If you're not yet a member, join the MileagePlus program now.
The researcher must not reside in a country currently on a United States sanctions list.
The researcher submitting the vulnerability must not be a current or former employee of United Airlines, any Star Alliance™ member airline or any other partner airline, a contractor of United Airlines, or a family member or household member of an employee of United Airlines or any partner airline.
The researcher submitting the vulnerability must not be the author of or have any prior affiliation with the vulnerable code.


Rules of Engagement:

Provide details of the vulnerability finding, including information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability using the submission form.
All vulnerabilities must pose a security threat in order to be eligible for a reward. United is ultimately responsible for determining the severity of an issue.
Vulnerabilities or potential vulnerabilities you discover may not at any time be disclosed publicly or to a third-party. Doing so will disqualify you from receiving award miles.
Do not attempt to conduct post-exploitation, including modification or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of United services.
Do not attempt to perform brute-force attacks, denial-of-service attacks, compromise or testing of United accounts that are not your own.
Do not attempt any testing on aircraft or aircraft systems such as inflight entertainment or inflight Wi-Fi.
Do not attempt to target United employees or customers using methods, including social engineering attacks, phishing attacks or physical attacks.
Do not perform physical attacks against United airport facilities.
Do not use automated scanners/tools.


Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as In-Scope. Any domain/property of United not listed in the targets section is out of scope. This includes any/all subdomains not listed above.  IF you happen to identify a security vulnerability on a target that is not in-scope, but that demonstrably belongs to United, it may be reported to this program and at United's discretion may be accepted and eligible for a reduced payout amount. Otherwise, out of scope submissions will be marked as ‘not applicable’ and will not be eligible for miles or points-based compensation.

Submission Instructions:
Please be aware that this program does not pay out any monetary rewards, they pay out in frequent flier miles for the United MileagePlus Program.
When submitting to the United program for the first time, please retrieve the tax forms from the below URLs and fill them out. When you make your first submission, encrypt the file with the attached United_VDP_Public_Key.txt. This will allow the United team to process your tax form at the end of the year for any miles that you have earned on the program.

No technology is perfect and FIS believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. We are excited for you to participate as a security researcher to help us identify vulnerabilities in our web apps. Good luck, and happy hunting!
Policy
FIS looks forward to working with the security community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our businesses and customers safe. FIS will make a best effort to respond to incoming reports within 5 business days and make a bounty determination after validating a legitimate security issue within 10 business days. We’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process. We encourage researchers to submit vulnerabilities in accordance with the following rules of engagement. Please ensure you following these guidelines to be eligible for a reward.
 
Program Rules

Do not publicly disclose a bug.
Impacting our customers or customer data without our explicit approval is strictly prohibited.
We reserve the right not to pay bounties for security bugs found in sites that are not owned/maintained by FIS. Please see scoping section for more details.
Any proof of concepts should NOT include images/statements that could cause reputational damage to FIS or it's customers. For example - Brand damage/tagging on takeover pages.
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
Internal pivoting, scanning, exploiting, or exfiltration data from internal FIS systems is forbidden. If you have * identified an RCE or similar vulnerability, please feel free to check in with us on how to best safely demonstrate a proof of concept.
Post-authentication vulnerabilities are much more likely to have internal duplicates and single core fixes.
Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is strictly prohibited.
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you can chain the vulnerabilities.
When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Do not perform any testing that causes degradation to FIS services; e.g. denial of service, or heavy automated scanning.
We reserve the right not to pay bounties for security bugs in or caused by additional third party software (e.g. binary plugins, extensions). If you have questions as to whether something is in scope, please ask us.

 
Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug.
The following issues are considered out of scope and are not included within our programme. Any reports of vulnerabilities in these domains will be closed as N/A and will not qualify for a bounty.

Reflective XSS
Any social engineering based attacks (getting a user to click a malicious/attacker controlled link, etc)
Subdomain Takeovers
Denial of service or Spamming (including layer 7 DOS attacks & Slowloris)
Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
Unauthenticated/logout/login CSRF.
Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without demonstrating a vulnerability.
Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS
Reports from automated tools or scans (without accompanying demonstration of exploitability)
Software version disclosure (without accompanying demonstration of exploitability)
Use of a known-vulnerable library (without evidence of exploitability)
Open redirects
Rate limiting issues that lead to spam
SPF/DMARC records
Missing best practices
Reports of insecure SSL/TLS issues (ciphers, certificates, etc)
User existence/enumeration vulnerabilities
Password and account recovery policies, such as reset link expiration or password complexity
Social engineering attacks against FIS employees, contractors, merchants, or business partners.
Any physical attempts against FIS property or data centers
Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc) which do not lead directly to a vulnerability
Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms
Host header injections unless you can show how they can lead to stealing user data.
Insecure cookie settings for non-sensitive cookies.
Vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated browsers or platforms
Issues related to software or protocols not under FIS control
Issues related to descriptive/verbose error messages
Issues which require physical access to a victim’s computer
Vulnerabilities in third party applications which make use of the FIS API
Vulnerabilities which involve privileged access to a victim's device(s)
Recently disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities. Please see announcement regarding this, we will reward 10% of the payout within the first 14 days from the Vendor releasing a patch, or full amount after 14 days.
Flash based vulnerabilities
Github leaks without demonstration of impact

 
Public Disclosure
As this is a private program, please do not discuss this program or any vulnerabilities (even resolved ones) outside of the program without express consent from the organization.
 
Internal Duplicates
Due to the number of assets being added into scope over the coming months, there will be some vulnerabilities that we're internally aware of. We will do our best to avoid these and will work to be as transparent as possible should you file a duplicate.
 
Access/Credentials

FIS does not provide authentication for accounts
Wherever possible, researchers should include 'Bugcrowd Bug Bounty' in plaintext to allow our SOC team to deconflict logging data
Access from Digital Ocean IP's may be restricted
Access from non US IP's may be restricted by our WAF

 
Third parties
Unfortunately this bug bounty program is not open to Third parties used for security testing, application development, etc. 
 
 
Please ensure that any FIS site you're testing belongs to FIS. This is possible using SSL Certs and DNS lookups. Please do NOT rely on Wikipedia to confirm what companies FIS have acquired. If you have any concerns about if an asset belongs to FIS, please reach out to Bugcrowd Support.
FIS provides a wide range of financial products and services, this includes web development, application hosting and DNS services. As of which, there will be a number of sites where FIS only owns a section of them. There will also be situations where we host the site, own the domain but are not contractually responsible for the security on that site. We strive to be as transparent as possible with our bug bounty community; if a report comes in that meets this criteria, we will work with the researcher to determine the best path forward, which may include engaging the customer/client.

Federal Communications Commission: Vulnerability Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/fcc-vdp,"


Introduction
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information. This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.
This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
We encourage you to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in our systems.
Authorization
If the FCC determines that you made a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve potential issues quickly, and the FCC will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research. Should legal action be initiated by a third party against you for activities that were conducted in accordance with this policy, we will make this authorization known.
1 “In the context of [the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Binding Operational Directive 20-01], “good faith” means security research conducted with the intent to follow an agency’s [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)] without any malicious motive; [the FCC] may evaluate an individual’s intent on multiple bases, including by their actions, statements, and the results of their actions. In other words, good faith security research means accessing a computer or software solely for purpose of testing or investigating a security flaw or vulnerability and disclosing those findings in alignment with the VDP. The security researcher’s actions should be consistent with an attempt to improve security and to avoid doing harm, either by unwarranted invasions of privacy or causing damage to property.” Additional information on what is meant by good faith can be found at https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01/#what-does-the-directive-mean-by-good-faith.
Guidelines
Under this policy, “research” means activities in which you:

Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
Make every effort to avoid privacy breaches, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data. In the event you encounter personally identifiable information during your testing, you will immediately cease testing and notify the FCC.
Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to pivot to other systems.
Provide us a minimum of 90 day’s to resolve the issue before requesting to publicly disclose the report.
Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.
Test methods
The following test methods are not authorized:

Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that impair access to or damage a system or data (Such as Brute Force Testing).
Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating), social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing.

Department of Homeland Security: Vulnerability Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/dhs-vdp,"


DHS has a unique information and communications technology footprint that is tightly interwoven and globally deployed. Many DHS technologies are deployed in critical infrastructure systems and, to varying degrees, support ongoing homeland security operations; the proper functioning of DHS systems and applications can have a life-or-death impact on DHS personnel and international allies and partners of the United States.
Our information systems provide critical services in support of the widespread, critical missions of DHS. Maintaining the security of our networks is a high priority at DHS. Ultimately, our network security ensures that we can accomplish our missions and contribute to the success of the individuals who contribute to the mission success.
DHS recognizes that security researchers regularly contribute to the work of securing organizations and the Internet as a whole. Therefore, DHS invites reports of any vulnerabilities discovered on internet-accessible DHS information systems, applications, and websites [1]. Information submitted to DHS under this policy will be used for defensive purposes – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks. This program upholds the DHS motto “See Something – Say Something” in the virtual environment by positively engaging with and establishing a communication loop between researchers and DHS.
Hereinafter, researcher [2] may be referred to as “you” or “your” and DHS may be interchangeably used in conjunction with or alternatively referenced as “we”, “our”, or “us”.

No technology is perfect and we believe that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. We are excited for you to participate as a security researcher to help us identify vulnerabilities in our assets. Good luck, and happy hunting!
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher which may be appealed if additional evidence of an increased impact can be provided.
We will also leverage CVSS ratings if there is any ambiguity in where the submission falls in the VRT to help maintain the severity and impact of the finding. CVSS generally tracks with the VRT as such:



Severity Level
Critical
High
Medium
Low
Informational




VRT
P1
P2
P3
P4
P5


CVSS v3
10.0-9.0
8.9-7.0
6.9-4.0
<= 3.9 Low Impact
<= 3.9 Informational



Note that we will not pay for submissions that count as Informational/P5.
We reserve the right to make any final determination of rating levels for any reported vulnerability. 
Out-of-Scope
Note that the scope of the program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in our software and websites only.  Social engineering attempts or any other attacks in the physical world are out of scope.
The Bullish exchange webapp and its APIs are out of scope and are covered under a separate program which can be found here
Qualifying Vulnerabilities

To qualify for bounty, the security bug must be original and previously unreported, and must be reported to us and only us.
We reserve the right to consider vulnerabilities in third party software as being in or out of scope.
We will consider those vulnerabilities as in scope if they meet the other requirements for originality and are not covered by another bug bounty program.
We will work with researchers to coordinate reports with third party programs.
Any reward for third party vulnerabilities will require engagement with requirements of the third party software including responsible disclosure.
Public disclosure of third party vulnerabilities even through recognized programs prior to a report to us will disqualify a report for a bounty.
Regardless of timing and eligibility for reward, we will still work to provide mitigation, disclosure and recognition as part of this program for third party researchers.

Non-Qualifying Vulnerabilities
General Out of Scope Items

Denial Of Service 
Out of concern for the availability of our services to all users, please do not attempt to carry out DoS attacks against public or 3rd parties, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam people, or engage in other behavior of a similar nature or with similar consequences.
URL redirection 
We recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in modern browsers; consequently, we hold that the usability and security benefits of a small number of well ­designed and closely monitored redirectors outweigh their true risks.
Phishing Websites 
We welcome reports of phishing websites using any marks, brands or similar identity to any our assets. However, we cannot pay bounties on such reports so as to avoid any creation of incentives for such efforts.
Flaws affecting the users of out ­of­ date systems. 
The security models of the web, software and blockchain are being constantly fine­-tuned. We will not typically reward any problems that affect only the users of outdated or unpatched systems.
""Coin Scams"" 
There are always scams present attempting to misappropriate real money, crypto currency and personal information. Except where such efforts infringe on a legally protected mark or identity We have no ability to intervene and therefore cannot pay bounties on such reports.

Third Party Assets - Additional Out of Scope Items

Third party software except as previously noted.
Public blockchains by third parties will always be out of scope.

The above being said, if you find outdated software and have good reasons to suspect that it poses a well defined security risk, please let us know. If you find security issues with third party public blockchain resources, block producers, etc. and are unable to establish contact directly we will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in establishing contact.
Staying out of Trouble
Violations of these requirements may result in us finding a researcher ineligible for a reward and/or disqualifying any such researcher for participation in the current program or any future programs. We may also disqualify a researcher for Safe Harbor under these program rules as well as local laws and regulations.

Please do not try to gain access into our offices, attempt social engineering attacks against our employees, etc.
Please, never attempt to access anyone else's data and do not engage in any activity that would be disruptive or damaging to users or to us.
Do not perform any actions which would adversely affect the integrity or availability of any data or systems without prior authorization from us.  This includes but is not limited to; website defacements, permanent modification or deletion of stored data, changes to the configuration of the operating system or running applications, etc.
Do not engage in any activity that is classed as illegal.
Do not use vulnerability testing tools that automatically generate significant volumes of traffic that could lead to the degradation of our systems or network.

Other rules

You represent and warrant that all submissions of vulnerability made by you are your own work, that you have not used information owned by another person or entity, and that you have the legal right to provide the submission of vulnerability in this program to us or Bugcrowd.
Current or past employees of Bullish or Block.one are not eligible for reward payments, however submissions are still welcome.
Bullish and our affiliates make no warranties, express or implied, guarantees or conditions with respect to the program. You understand that your participation in the program is at your own risk. To the extent permitted under any applicable laws and regulations, we exclude any implied warranties in connection with the program.
If you do not agree to these terms, please do not provide us with any submissions or otherwise participate in this program.

We appreciate your efforts and hard work helping to make the users of our products more secure, and we look forward to working with the researcher community to create a meaningful and successful bug bounty program. Good luck and happy hunting

Ratings & Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood, impact, or underlying risk to Aruba Networks. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.

Disclosure
At the current time Aruba has chosen to not participate in the Bugcrowd's coordinated disclosure program. However, we do support disclosure from our programs based upon the following guideline:
Aruba handles and discloses vulnerabilities in accordance with ISO/IEC 30111.
Public disclosure of vulnerabilities will generally take place only after permanent fixes are available. Where the vulnerability occurs in multiple branches of software, or in multiple software products, Aruba will publish advisories once the last branch or product is updated and released. However, if Aruba learns that information about an unpublished vulnerability is being communicated externally, a vulnerability advisory will be published immediately along with details of any possible workaround or defense. In the case of vulnerabilities in open-source software that are being publicly discussed, Aruba will immediately issue a security advisory once it has been determined that the vulnerability affects an Aruba product.
The initial vulnerability advisory will consist of general information about the vulnerability, workarounds, and steps to resolve the vulnerability. The public advisory is the only information that Aruba will provide to anyone for the first 60 days. After 60 days Aruba may, at its sole discretion, make public full details about the vulnerability. Security researchers who wish to publicize Aruba vulnerability details (e.g. in a blog or at a conference) are asked to wait for the same 60-day period after an advisory has been published. As a courtesy, we request you inform Aruba that such presentation will be given.
Disclosure is not selective under any circumstances. It is Aruba’s policy to notify all customers of vulnerabilities at the same time. No Aruba customer, partner, or third-party is given advance notification or additional details of a vulnerability. Aruba’s OEM partners are generally notified three days in advance of public disclosure to allow their respective security response teams to prepare for notification of their own customers. Aruba’s OEM partners have agreed contractually to coordinate vulnerability notifications with Aruba so that all end users are alerted at the same time. Aruba’s customer-facing employees (TAC, SE, etc.) are provided a copy of the advisory approximately 18 hours before public disclosure, but are prohibited from sharing that information until it is officially released. OEM partners and customer-facing employees are only given a copy of the public advisory; they are not provided with full details of a vulnerability.

Bonus Rewards
At Aruba Networks' discretion, we are willing to pay up to $5,000 for unauthenticated vulnerabilities in ArubaOS or Aruba Instant that we consider to be highly critical in nature. For those of you with access to APs we are especially interested in vulnerabilities where an unprivileged user connected to our (properly configured) network infrastructure can exploit the system.
Examples:

Wi-Fi authentication bypass
Wi-Fi leaking encryption keys
Bypassing or subverting firewall rules
Impersonation of other users on a WPA2-protected Wi-Fi network
Captive portal bypass
Compromise of a network administrator using Wi-Fi frames. 
Injection of malicious traffic in a WPA2 802.1X transaction that successfully compromises ClearPass through the RADIUS protocol

Notice that attempting to exploit many of these flaws will require you to be in possession of Aruba APs at a minimum. We unfortunately do not have a hardware budget at this time but we will be happy to provide software for any hardware in your possession if you reach out to us.

Here at Opera, we are excited to work with the security community to secure our products and services. Before reporting a vulnerability, please make sure you review the following program rules. Good luck, and happy hunting! 
Rewards:
A demonstrated security impact described in the ticket by the reporter and then confirmed by Opera is the key factor that drives bounty range. We expect the reporter to provide a realistic attack scenario, evaluate the impact and honestly report it. The more potential damage we were saved from by disclosing a vulnerability, the higher the payout. 
Some examples of high-impact vulnerabilities:



Confirmed impact
Bounty  [USD]




A demonstrated leak of end-user personal data from production servers at scale (database or file storage dump, or ability to harvest data systematically).
5-10K


Ability to deface or modify a key Opera production website (e.g. www.opera.com).
5-10K


Break a significant “security requirement” [1] of any Opera’s product.
2-10K


A demonstrated scenario to take administrative control over core infrastructure in production (network devices, hardware, hypervisors).
5-10K


A demonstrated scenario to take administrative control over web application panels in production.
1-5K


Anything less impactful.
< 1K


No impact was demonstrated in the submission.
0



[1] Examples of what constitutes breaking a significant security requirement: 

Use Opera paid services or premium features for free. 
Hijack end-user valuable assets (account balances, earnings, artifacts).
Theft of arbitrary files from the local system.
Opera Account takeover without any social engineering. 
Disclosure of secrets (e.g. messages in Flow). 
Spoofing of full URL bar or SSL integrity checks bypass. 
Vertical privilege escalation. 
0-click disclosure of browsing history. 
Achieving native code execution. 
Memory corruption leading to a limited or arbitrary memory read or write. 
JavaScript injection into browser UI or other origins. 

Please note that in terms of the quality of your report, we will be looking at the following points: 

The issue description is clear and understandable. 
The issue is a vulnerability, not simply a security risk or missing best practice. 
The target and attack method is in-scope as per our program’s brief. 
A realistic, repeatable, and unconditional attack scenario is provided. 
A real security impact is honestly reported. 
Reproduction steps, proof of concept, or exploit is submitted and it works.

To qualify for any monetary reward, all of those requirements have to be met. 
Please note that any manipulative behavior or other counts of not complying with Bugcrowd’s Code of Conduct will also be taken into account, and may result in disqualification from being rewarded even if the submission is valid. 
Video PoC & Screenshots
If you create a video PoC, please do so on a password-protected Vimeo upload and include the link in your submission. Please embed screenshots into your submission rather than just simply uploading them as attachments. We strongly recommend setting English locale when taking screenshots or recording videos.

eero,https://bugcrowd.com/eero,"


An eero system is made up of an embedded device, which we refer to as a node, that provides WIFi functionality either singly or in a mesh with other nodes. Nodes are controlled via using mobile applications on both iOS and Android, which communicate with the nodes via a cloud service. The nodes run a customized version of Linux with some proprietary software as well as a significant number of open source components. The eero Bugcrowd program aims to cover all three aspects of the eero system: node, cloud, and mobile apps. 
Our goal for for this program is to ensure the security of the eero system as a whole, with a focus on preventing an attacker from being able to control a set of nodes in a distributed manner or being able to gain information about the user via information leakage.
This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritization/rating of findings.
In addition to the Bugcrowd VRT, eero has developed some more applicable ratings and categories that are specific to these targets. This supplemental VRT can be seen here.

Skyscanner,https://bugcrowd.com/skyscanner,"


Welcome to Skyscanner's Bug Bounty program
Keeping traveller's information safe and secure is a top priority for Skyscanner. We welcome the contribution of security researchers and look forward to rewarding them for their invaluable contribution to the security of all Skyscanner travellers.
We invite researchers to test the Skyscanner website and mobile apps in line with the principles set out in this brief.
Guidelines
We request thorough proof-of-concept/replication of the bug, including videos, images, and a description of the business impact. These will all factor into our bounty decision-making process.
To promote the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities we ask that you:

share the security issue with us in detail
act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services (including Denial of Service)
comply with all applicable laws
understand that all valid reports will be taken seriously by our engineering teams

Expectations
We expect researchers to follow the program rules:
Researchers must:

add the following header to all HTTP requests: Skyscanner-Security: Bugcrowd

use your username@bugcrowdninja.com email address for accounts
not access or modify our, or travellers' data, without explicit prior permission of the owner. Only interact with your own accounts or provided test accounts for security research purposes
contact us immediately if you inadvertently encounter traveller data. Do not view, alter, save, store, transfer, or otherwise access the data, and immediately purge any local information upon reporting the vulnerability to Skyscanner
perform testing and research only within the areas that are in scope
follow the Bugcrowd Coordinated Disclosure rules


In addition, we count the following activities as strictly prohibited, and thus not rewardable. These are in addition to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy:

Social Engineering attacks
DDoS
Excessive use of automated vulnerability / scanning tools


Please do not spam forms or account creation flows using automated scanners
We have a number of rate limits in place that may result in your IP address being blocked if you use such tools


Any testing of corporate email (*@skyscanner.net)

We will offer monetary rewards for the first submitted report of a vulnerability.
Public disclosure of the vulnerability prior to resolution may cancel a pending reward. We reserve the right to disqualify individuals from the program for disrespectful or disruptive behaviour.
We will not negotiate in response to duress or threats (e.g. we will not negotiate the payout amount under threat of withholding the vulnerability, or of releasing the vulnerability or any exposed data to the public).
We reserve the right to deduct a 10% penalty on valid and accepted submissions that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above. Following the guidelines will help us triage the vulnerability more effectively from our side, which should result in faster processing of the submission
We are under no obligation to pay out for any bugs that are not submitted in accordance with this policy or any of the Bugcrowd policies.
We reserve the right to withdraw this scheme at any time and shall have no obligation to pay out for any bugs submitted after closure of the scheme.

Rating & Reward Information:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program uses the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, please note that in some cases, the priority rating will be altered due to reflect the likelihood or impact of an exploit. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
We will award greater bounties for all valid submissions contained in our Focus Areas (see Target Information).

Reward range




P1
$3,000 – $8,000*


P2
$900 – $3,000*

*The highest rewards will be reserved for submissions deemed to have high business criticality.
Other:

Vulnerabilities found in multiple fields in the same form or using the same CSRF token will be counted as a single vulnerability. Subsequent submissions will be marked as Not Applicable. Please detail all affected fields in a single submission.
Vulnerabilities that can be exploited with similar payloads on the same path are only eligible for a single reward. Subsequent submissions will be marked Not Applicable.


Safe Harbor compliance
When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

Overall Program Rules:

Observe strict adherence to the program scope.


Please provide a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) if you are able to do so.


Do not perform attacks that may disable or harm Mastercard services (E.g.: DDoS/Spam)
If you inadvertently cause a privacy violation or disruption (such as accessing account data, service configurations, or other confidential information) while investigating an issue, please be sure to disclose this in your report.
Test ONLY against your own accounts – testing must not disrupt or compromise any data or data access that is not yours. Furthermore, never run tests against users or accounts that are not yours.
By submitting the vulnerability, you affirm that you have not disclosed - and agree that you will not disclose - your finding (or the existence of your submission) other than via the Mastercard Bug Bounty Process.
The review panel reserves the right to reject any submission at their sole discretion. Proper explanations will be provided in such cases to the researcher.

Tesla,https://bugcrowd.com/tesla,"


Tesla values the work done by security researchers in improving the security of our products and service offerings. We are committed to working with this community to verify, reproduce, and respond to legitimate reported vulnerabilities. We encourage the community to participate in our responsible reporting process.
For vehicle or energy products 
While we use Bugcrowd as a platform for rewarding all issues, please report vehicle and product related issues directly to vulnerabilityreporting@tesla.com, using our GPG key to encrypt reports containing sensitive information.
Third-party bugs
If issues reported to our bug bounty program affect a third-party library, external project, or another vendor, Tesla reserves the right to forward details of the issue to that party without further discussion with the researcher. We will do our best to coordinate and communicate with researchers through this process.
Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly correct any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you nor ask law enforcement to investigate you providing you comply with the following Responsible Disclosure Guidelines:

Provide details of the vulnerability, including information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability and a Proof of Concept (POC).  Any vulnerability that implicates functionality not resident on a research-registered vehicle must be reported within 168 hours and zero minutes (7 days) of identifying the vulnerability.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.
Do not modify or access data that does not belong to you.
Give Tesla a reasonable time to correct the issue before making any information public.

For the avoidance of doubt,

If, through your good-faith security research, you (a pre-approved, good-faith security researcher) cause a software issue that requires your research-registered vehicle to be updated or ""reflashed,"" as an act of goodwill, Tesla shall make reasonable efforts to update or ""reflash"" Tesla software on the research-registered vehicle by over-the-air update, offering assistance at a service center to restore the vehicle's software using our standard service tools, or other actions we deem appropriate. Tesla has complete discretion as to the software or other assistance that will be provided and it may be only for a limited number of times. Tesla's support does not extend to any out-of-pocket expenses (e.g. towing) incurred by you. Tesla reserves the right to limit the number of service requests per pre-approved, good-faith researcher and unregister a research-registered vehicle at any time.
Tesla considers that a pre-approved, good-faith security researcher who complies with this policy to access a computer on a research-registered vehicle has not accessed a computer without authorization or exceeded authorized access under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA"").
Tesla will not bring a copyright infringement claim under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA"") against a pre-approved, good-faith security researcher who circumvents security mechanism, so long as the researcher does not access any other code or binaries.
Tesla will not consider software changes, as a result of good-faith security research performed by a good-faith security researcher, to a security-registered vehicle to void the vehicle warranty of the security-registered vehicle, notwithstanding that any damage to the car resulting from any software modifications will not be covered by Tesla under the vehicle warranty.

Viator,https://bugcrowd.com/viator,"


We appreciate all security concerns brought forth and are constantly striving to keep on top of the latest threats. Being pro-active rather than re-active to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at Viator.
Every day new security issues and attack vectors are created. Viator strives to keep abreast on the latest state-of-the-art security developments by working with security researchers and companies. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure world.
We would like to get as broad coverage as possible but we also have to be sensitive to our suppliers, as well as our users, so we would like all testing to be done with an awareness that some actions will directly affect many people outside of our company. For example, a review of a tour which contains incorrect statements about the tour could negatively affect future bookings for that tour and the supplier. 
Another example is making test bookings on production for real products and suppliers. The supplier may not necessarily be aware they are test bookings. This can result in unused inventory for the supplier. Accordingly, we request that testers abide by the guidelines below.
Our primary interest is finding security holes. We are not at this time interested in attacks on content quality, vulnerability to spamming, manipulation of tour ratings, or manipulation of user generated content (user submitted tour reviews and photos).
Test booking guidelines:
Whenever making any test bookings, signing up as a partner, or initiating any Live Chats always use BUGCROWD in the name or language
We would request that you keep test bookings to a minimum. But they are possible and necessary to test the payment and post-purchase workflows on our systems.
To make a test booking please follow the following rules...

Make sure the surname for all travellers is TEST
 Make sure you add ""This is a test booking - please ignore"" in the Special Requirements field
 Please only book the following product codes: 73111P1, 73111AUTOTEST1, 73111AUTOTEST5, 73111AUTOTEST8, 73111AUTOTEST10
-- Note: to use a test product you'll need to search for it directly in the search box on the homepage
-- Test products do not return in product searches and are not on any of the listings pages
-- URL will look like this: https://www.viator.com/tours/Barcelona/Automated-Test-Product-Only/d562-73111AUTOTEST10
Make sure it is booked for a date at least 3 months in advance
Use your own credit card to complete the booking
Once your testing is complete please go into the booking self service screen and cancel your booking for a full refund to your credit card. Please make sure to do this at least 2 months before the original booking date 

To make a test Suppliers through Viator's supplier sign up page, start the supplier name with BUGCROWD 
Please make sure to accurately follow the above steps to avoid a charge to your credit card

Cloudways,https://bugcrowd.com/cloudways,"


Cloudways is a managed web hosting platform that specializes in providing an easy-to-manage environment for web applications.
The idea behind offering bounty for bugs is to tap into the expertise of the InfoSec community and discover the gaps in the Cloudways Platform’s security. The emphasis is on offering a secure user experience to our customers and to ensure that the Cloudways Platform remains the most secure managed hosting option for our users. 

Ratings & Rewards:
At its core, this program adheres to the standard BugCrowd Vulnerability Taxonomy Rating (VRT), and initial bug priorities (and thus, the rewards) will be decided on the basis of VRT. However, in some cases the Bug priority can be revised (with consequent impact on the rewards) because of the likelihood of occurrence and impact on the below-mentioned Cloudways Targets.  We reserve the right to change the priority and associated rewards of a vulnerability after assessing its impact. 
Vulnerabilities that lie in “Non-Rewarded” section will only be rewarded Kudos points. These vulnerabilities are listed in the section below. 
Non-rewarded findings:



Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)






Please be aware that Cloudways may take up to three weeks to accept any given submission and allocate the reward. No rewards should take longer than three weeks to process.

"
Wise (ex-TransferWise),https://bugcrowd.com/wise,"


We are committed to ensuring a safe and secure service for our customers and we value the work done by security researchers in improving the security of our products. We are committed to working with this community to verify, reproduce, and respond to reported vulnerabilities. We encourage the community to participate in our responsible reporting process.
Expectations
When participating in our responsible reporting process, you can expect us to:

Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely triage of your submission by our partner, Bugcrowd
Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in line with our internal vulnerability management policy (from 1 to 180 days depending on severity)
Keep you informed when the issue is fixed; and
If eligible, reward you accordingly

Third-party bugs
If issues reported to our bug bounty program affect a third-party library, external project, or another vendor, we reserve the right to forward details of the issue along to that party without further discussion with you (the researcher). We will do our best to coordinate and communicate with you throughout the process. However, these bugs will not be rewarded.
House Rules
To benefit from the knowledge of security researchers, we encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in our platform. To avoid confusion between legitimate security research through the Bugcrowd program and a malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:

Play by the rules. This includes following our disclosure policy, including Bugcrowd’s standard
disclosure terms and any other relevant agreements;
Handle the confidentiality of details of any discovered vulnerabilities according to our Disclosure Policy;
Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly, provide details of the vulnerability, including
information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability and if applicable, a Proof of Concept;
Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying or modifying data not belonging
to your test account, and/or harming user experience;
If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: limit the amount of data you access to the
minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept (PoC); and cease testing. Submit a
report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable
Information (PII), sensitive data, or proprietary information;
Although usage of automated vulnerability discovery tools is allowed, you should exercise common sense and avoid overly broad
scans that initiate a huge amount of needless requests. This might result in us rate-limiting or blocking
you, or closing your testing account. Do not simply send us a scanner's default output - focus on specific finding and clearly demonstrate impact (PoC). When scanning, use your Bugcrowd testing account (authenticated scans) or make it clear with the User-Agent header that you are a researcher. As we're seeing legitimate attacks, this information is useful for us for triage;
You should only interact with test accounts you own;
Do not engage in extortion;
Use the official Bugcrowd channel to discuss vulnerability information with us;

Safe-harbour Compliance
We consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorized” access under anti-hacking laws. To the extent your activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our Acceptable Use Policy, we waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of permitting security research under this policy. We will not bring a claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy. We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy.
You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please reach out to us directly before going any further.

Disclosure Policy
This program does not allow disclosure. Although we have chosen to adopt a non-disclosure policy, this is temporary. In the meantime, you MUST not release information to any third party (and the public) about vulnerabilities found and/or remediation measures implemented.
Priority Modelling
This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the severity rating and prioritization of issues.
Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
We will investigate legitimate reports and make every effort to quickly correct any vulnerability. To encourage responsible reporting, we will not take legal action against you nor ask law enforcement to investigate you providing you comply with the following Responsible Disclosure Guidelines:

Provide details of the vulnerability, including information needed to reproduce and validate the vulnerability and a Proof of Concept (POC)
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
Do not modify or access data that does not belong to you

This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the rating/prioritization of issues.

Takeaway.com,https://bugcrowd.com/takeaway,"


Takeaway.com welcomes security researchers to review our public-facing defenses with an objective, professional eye. Earn rewards, bragging rights, and security experience to level up!
We do not want to hide our mistakes, but please allow us to take appropriate measures before disclosing any vulnerabilities to the outside world.

Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd
Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a
vulnerability priority will be modified by us due to its likelihood or impact. The main
criteria here are certain risks with regard to Takeaway.com's platform and business. In
some cases, we also consider the amount of effort required to identify a vulnerability
(i.e., we typically do not appreciate submissions based solely on the results of
automated scans, unless it reveals something really interesting). In instances where an
issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher,
along with the opportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority. Rewards for
this program are currently split into 2 groups in terms of scope, to help the
researchers focus more on the important parts for our business flow. You can find the
respective ranges for each group below.

HealthifyMe's Vulnerability Disclosure Program,https://bugcrowd.com/healthifyme,"


About:
HealthifyMe invites you to test and help secure our publicly accessible web presence - focusing on, but not limited to, our web and mobile applications. We appreciate your efforts and hard work in making the internet more secure, and look forward to working with the researcher community to create a meaningful and successful bug bounty program. Good luck and happy hunting!

Ratings:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
Submission suggestion:
Providing a video POC is highly encouraged. Submissions with a clear video POC are generally processed faster than those without.

Trello,https://bugcrowd.com/trello,"


Trusted by millions, Trello is a visual collaboration tool that creates a shared perspective on any project. Trello’s boards, lists, and cards enable you to organize and prioritize your personal and work life in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way.
Ratings/Rewards and Bounty Rules:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
Note: Atlassian uses CVSS to consistently score security vulnerabilities. Where discrepancies between the VRT and CVSS score exist, Atlassian will defer to the CVSS score to determine the priority.
To qualify for a bounty you must:

Report a qualifying vulnerability that is in the scope of our program (also below)
Be the first person to report the vulnerability
Adhere to our disclosure guidelines (see below)
Only test against your own accounts and data
Be reasonable with automated scanning methods so as to not degrade services
Refrain from disclosing the vulnerability until we've addressed it
Communicate with our security team exclusively via Bugcrowd (the security team will be way more impressed by your exploits than our support or social media teams)

Access/Credentials
You are free to make as many accounts as needed to test on Trello - please ensure that you use your @bugcrowdninja.com email address.

Rewarding security bugs in our open source projects
Square recognizes the important contributions the security research community can make. Part of keeping Square's customers safe is making sure that we find and fix any security issues in our open source projects. If you find any vulnerabilities in any of our participating open source projects, send us a report. Even better, send us a fix!
Note that this program is to report issues in our open source projects. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in one of Square's domains (squareup.com, square.com, or cash.me) or mobile applications (Square Point of Sale, Square Cash App), please report them to our other Square bug bounty program.

Attributes of a good report

Detailed explanation & proof-of-concept for the bug
Include specific source code references for the issue from our GitHub
Include repository, release version, branch and other information
Describe the real-world impact/exploitability of the bug

Ineligible reports

Issues related to software not under our control (such as external dependencies) are not eligible for a reward. 
Most of our open source development is publicly visible. Reports related to an issue being fixed in a branch or being tracked in a public way will therefore not be eligible for a bounty.
Reports of issues without a proof-of-concept or clear path to exploitation. You may still report these, but will not be eligible for a monetary reward.
Issues which can only be reproduced on specific combinations of hardware or software not used by Square.

How to send a fix
Please do not open a pull request or GitHub ticket to fix an issue you're reporting. This would unnecessarily reveal any potential vulnerabilities. Instead, if you'd like to send us a fix, attach a patch file to the issue you open. You'll need to sign our Individual Contributor License Agreement before any patches can be accepted.
Rewards
Rewards range from $100 to $10,000 depending on the type of issue and impact. We prioritize and reward issues based on the real-world impact to our software and systems as operated by Square. The values below represent upper bounds and rewards may vary in practice.

Etsy,https://bugcrowd.com/etsy,"


Program Overview
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. Within our markets, millions of people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. We also offer a wide range of Seller Services and tools that help creative entrepreneurs start, manage and scale their businesses. Our mission is to Keep Commerce Human.
Etsy's been running a bug bounty program since 2012. Our goal is to reward security researchers who follow responsible disclosure principles and proactively reach out to us if they’ve identified a vulnerability which would impact the safety of our marketplace or members. We believe that this is industry best practice. 
Please use your @bugcrowdninja.com email address to create your testing account(s). We reserve the right to delete and block test accounts that are found to be abusing our testing guidelines.

Vulnerability Guidelines & Exceptions

Vulnerability reports MUST have a proof of concept or detailed explanation of the security issue. 
Please note the Vulnerability Exceptions section for a list of vulnerabilities which are NOT accepted.
Higher quality reproduction steps and reports will be a strong factor in determining a valid issue's final bounty reward amount (In general, better reports -> bigger bounty reward). PLEASE provide clear step-by-step for replication.

Rewards
This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritization/rating of findings. Changes to VRT priorities for certain bugs are listed below:

Third Party Bugs
Etsy uses a number of third-party providers and services. We cannot authorize security testing against systems that do not belong to us, but strongly suggest reporting issues identified within these services to the third-party directly.
However, if you believe an issue with one of our third-party service providers is the result of Etsy's misconfiguration or insecure usage of that service (or you've reported an issue affecting many customers of the service that you believe Etsy can temporarily mitigate without stopping usage of the service while a fix is implemented upstream), we'd appreciate your report regarding the issue.
Keep in mind that any reports regarding third-party services are rewarded on a case-by-case basis, and usually at a percentage of our normal payout.

Cisco Meraki,https://bugcrowd.com/ciscomeraki,"


The security of our customers is a top priority. We invest heavily in tools, processes and technologies to keep our users and their networks safe. This includes third-party audits, features like two-factor authentication, and our out-of-band cloud management architecture. The Cisco Meraki vulnerability rewards program is an important component of our overall security strategy, encouraging external researchers to collaborate with our security team to help keep our customers safe.
Please note: Cisco Meraki regularly releases new code and functionality; updates will be posted in the announcement section highlighting new code. This is a great opportunity for Cisco Meraki and the researcher community to work together to find vulnerabilities! In the event you do not find a bug today, please check back tomorrow! Be sure to watch for new releases on Cisco Meraki's changelog
Reporting Security Issues
If you are a user and have a security issue to report regarding your account (e.g. password problems and account abuse issues), non-security bugs, and questions about your network, please contact Cisco Meraki Support.
When properly notified of legitimate issues, we will acknowledge your report, assign resources and fix potential problems as quickly as possible. Some of our products and services are complex and take time to update; in the spirit of furthering security, we ask that you provide reasonable time for us to address any vulnerabilities. Failure to adhere to the principle of responsible disclosure will result in the report not qualifying for a reward. 
Your testing itself must also be responsible. We ask that you refrain from using any tools that are likely to automatically generate significant volumes of traffic. Your testing must also not violate the law or compromise any data that is not your own. When investigating a vulnerability, please only target your own account. Never attempt to access the data of anyone else and do not engage in any activity that would be damaging to Cisco Meraki, Cisco Meraki customers or Cisco Meraki users. 
Program Scope
Only certain targets and types of attack are in scope. In the next section, we clarify the targets and attacks that are in scope and out of scope. We also provide clarifying information on the targets. Please see the “Rewards” section for our priorities and corresponding reward ranges.
Meraki is able to ship free hardware to eligible researchers. We want to encourage testing of in-scope targets. Please check the “Eligibility for Meraki hardware” section on this page, or click on the ”Program Updates” tab, for more information on our free hardware shipping program.
Our bug bounty program is aimed at helping test and secure the following in-scope Meraki targets. Researchers can, and are encouraged to, create their own ""organization"" and accounts for testing.

Bitdefender Box v2,https://bugcrowd.com/bitdefenderbox2,"


Bitdefender BOX protects all devices connected to the Internet, not just a laptop or desktop computer. BOX secures smartphones, smart TVs, and all your other home appliances, like Wi-Fi thermostats, gaming consoles, and even your baby monitor). BOX can be controlled from the central website or the easy-to-use mobile app. 
Bitdefender Box2 Testing Device
Researchers must supply their own device for testing. If you don't already own a Box2, you can acquire a device in 2 ways: 
1) Purchase a device through the Bitdefender website.
2) Qualify as an ""Expert Researcher"" (survey link below). 

Rewards & Priorities
The scope of this bounty program is to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited as a guest, or remotely. (e.g. a friend coming at your place, connecting to your WIFI network and hack your box device OR exploiting other customer devices remotely).
It's important to note that the Bitdefender Box communicates through a cloud app - however, this program is provided exclusively for the reporting of security issues pertaining to any communication directly to/from the Box itself. If you're able to identify any vulnerabilities in the cloud app, they should be reported here: https://bugcrowd.com/bitdefender. The Bitdefender Security team will determine the nature and impact of the vulnerabilities at their sole discretion. The following vulnerabilities are in-scope for the program:

1.a) Remote Code Execution - Ability to get remote code execution against the BOX without proper authorization (not on the same LAN) - achieving this objective will be rewarded in the range of 5000$
1.b) Ability to access/control the BOX remotely without proper authorization (not on the same LAN) - reward varies depending on impact
2.a) Remote Code Execution - Ability to get remote code execution against the BOX without proper authorization (ON the same LAN) - achieving this objective will be rewarded in the range of 2500$
2.b) Ability to access/control the BOX without proper authorization (ON the same LAN) - reward varies depending on impact
3.a) DOS - crash our product remotely (not on the same LAN) - 2500$
3.b) DOS - crash our product (ON the same LAN) - 1000$
Attacking your own device from a BOX Administrator standpoint is not eligible for reward

Vulnerabilities submitted which are not included in the above list may not be rewarded. This is decided at the sole discretion of the Bitdefender team. See Scope - Additional Details for more information on scoping. Furthermore, ONLY vulnerabilities on BOX products are out-of-scope. Vulnerabilities found on Bitdefender mobile apps & central.bitdefender.com are out-of-scope.

Account Setup - Mobile App
All instructions for the product are in the BOX package (default passwords, how to configure, etc). To configure/setup BOX v2, install the ""Bitdefender Central"" mobile application. Create an account or log in using an existing account. User accounts are shared by the mobile & web apps. Please note that the mobile app is not in scope for this program. However, if you believe you've found a way to be able to control someone else's device via the mobile app, you're encouraged to submit it - and we'll review whether it's in scope or rewardable.


Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitdefender.centralmgmt


iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/ro/app/bitdefender-central/id969933082?mt=8


Account Setup - Web App
The BOX is managed via the Bitdefender Central App https://central.bitdefender.com. Login using the same account registered via the mobile application. User accounts are shared by the mobile & web apps. Please note that any vulnerabilities found in the webapp should be reported here: https://bugcrowd.com/bitdefender - and not to this program.

Serious about security
Our approach to security is designed to protect buyers and sellers. We monitor every transaction, continuously innovate in fraud prevention, and we protect businesses’ data like our business depends on it—because it does. We adhere to industry-leading standards to manage our network, secure our web and client applications, and set policies across our organization.

This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritization/rating of findings.
Rewards:
We are particularly interested in problems with Square’s payment flows. Confirmed vulnerabilities that directly affect our payments flows and comply with these terms will receive a $500 minimum reward.
A Note on Similar Submissions:
We ask that researchers who are able to identify the same or similar types of issues in multiple locations across one of our applications combine those findings into a single submission that includes a description as well as the various locations where vulnerabilities have been identified. This greatly assists us in our triage process and allows us to process your submissions faster. The combined submissions will be evaluated holistically and will receive rewards corresponding to the collective findings. For example, if an application is discovered to have broken access control on a number of API endpoints, please submit a single submission that includes a list of those API endpoints. If separate submissions are made, they may be inadvertently closed as duplicates.

Overview
Concur Technologies is committed to making travel and expense management easy and secure. As part of our promise to protect customer data and privacy, we strongly encourage prompt responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities you may find while using our products and welcome your reports.
When submitting, please keep the following in mind:

Please provide clear and reproducible steps that demonstrate that the vulnerability exists, is persistent, and can be exploited. Your written description should be easily understood in English, and attaching a proof-of-exploitability video is even more helpful. 
Vulnerability reports which do not include careful manual validation—for example, reports based only on results from automated tools and scanners or which describe theoretical attack vectors without proof of exploitability—will be closed as Not Applicable.


This program covers all Concur-owned applications, services, and properties, including any browser UI, web service, or mobile app for each product. Please be sure to check domain records to confirm Concur ownership; avoid testing of assets not owned and controlled by Concur.
Some examples include:

Concur Travel, Expense, and Invoice solutions (*.concur.com and *.concursolutions.com)
TMC Solutions (see a list of included products)
TripIt (*.tripit.com)
Hipmunk (*.hipmunk.com)
ConcurGov
Ulysse

Program Rules:
Public disclosure is prohibited without the express prior written consent of Concur.

Carefully comply with applicable laws regarding unauthorized system access and tampering by only performing research under this responsible disclosure program. Proof of exploitability must stop short of actual exploitation. 
Never intentionally access, modify, destroy, or make unavailable Concur user data or Concur itself in the process of discovery. This includes execution of Denial of Service exploits.

Immediately notify Concur Security if any user data other than your own is unintentionally accessed. 
Never leak or publicly disclose any Concur user data, including your own. 
Never defraud Concur users or the Concur platform itself in the process of discovery or using data discovered through your research. 
You further agree that you will comply with end-user agreements and will never perform security research on your own company’s Concur instance. You may either sign up for trial organization or contact us for access to a sandbox organization.
Concur Mobile binaries should be obtained through official channels for iOS and Android platforms. While Concur does not encourage rooting/jailbreaking of mobile devices, we understand that this technique may be necessary for extracting and validating the Concur Mobile app. Accessing Concur Mobile binaries by rooting or jailbreaking your device is permitted only with test accounts in the context of security research through this program; circumventing platform protections in order to access production accounts, including those for companies you may belong to, is strictly prohibited.

LastPass,https://bugcrowd.com/lastpass,"


LastPass is helping people achieve effortless security, at home and in the workplace. As our business and personal worlds intersect on an increasing scale in our cloud-centric world, a strong foundation of secure authentication and access is critical to keeping systems, data, and assets safe. As a secure password manager trusted by millions of consumers and tens of thousands of companies worldwide, LastPass is designed to safely store passwords and grant access to the technology and services they rely on every day. 
A core mission at LastPass is to keep customer information both private and secure. We appreciate your contribution to help us improve the security of our product. When valid reports are found, we offer rewards proportionate with the severity of the issue for eligible discovered issues. 
How We Operate

With new submissions, our Bugcrowd Application Security Engineer takes the initial review to ensure the submission includes the requirements noted in the Attributes of a Rewarded Report section. Generally speaking, they will be the first to respond to the report. 
After preliminaryl validation of eligibility from Bugcrowd, LastPass program owners will move forward with the assessment of the submission. We may ask for more information and work with the reporter to reproduce, validate and mitigate the issue properly.

For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority may be modified due to its likelihood or impact based on LastPass product decision.

If your report is determined to be valid and in scope, it will be moved to the Unresolved state and you will receive your reward according to the Reward Range section. 
Once the issue has been fixed you are free to publish your findings, following the steps mentioned in the Responsible Disclosure section. 
Communication with our security team should happen exclusively via Bugcrowd. During the process from the submission of the issue until closing it, we will communicate back to you about the progress here in Bugcrowd. 

Note:

If you are an Enterprise customer of LastPass who believes they have discovered a potential vulnerability or security concern, we kindly ask you to contact your assigned Customer Success Manager or Customer Relationship Manager instead of submitting a submission to Bugcrowd. 
Customers can also submit a support ticket here.
For researchers, enterprise features are still in scope of this bounty program. Targeting that part of the application will require you to create an enterprise or teams trial account. If the provided fourteen (14) day trial period is not enough for your testing purposes, let us know in the submission comments section and we can extend your trial. 

Responsible Disclosure
LastPass appreciates the contributions made by the research community and understands that transparency is an important aspect to raising awareness and improving computer security. We will be happy to help you share your findings if you follow the conditions mentioned in Bugcrowd’s standard disclosure terms. Additionally, we ask that you do not disclose any details about the reported vulnerability until the fix is completed and marked ""Resolved"". After that, please provide the draft of your publication plan for our review. Details of this process can be discussed through the Bugcrowd submission’s comment section. 
It is important to note that any information you receive or collect about LastPass, its engineers or customers through this program must be kept confidential, only shared on “as needed” basis, and is not allowed to be published or externally distributed unless it was previously discussed and accepted during the review process. 
Attributes of a Rewarded Report:

Report a vulnerability that is within the scope of our program described in the In-Scope/Out-of- Scope/Excluded Items sections below. 
Be the first person to report the vulnerability. 
Provide proper details of the vulnerability containing: 


A proof of concept 
Detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability 
Describe the versions of all relevant components of the attack (e.g., extension - browser, OS, mobile app version, etc.) 
Explanation of how the attack could be executed in a real-world scenario 


Eligible participants must make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction, disclosure, or unauthorized access of data, interruption, interference (e.g. through a distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attack or degradation of our services. 
Pleasant communication and being cooperative is always a big plus and highly appreciated. 

Ratings
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal and make a case for a higher priority. Please see below for any deviations from the standard VRT.
In-Scope 
In-Scope items are listed in the Program Scope section as In-Scope items.
Anything not explicitly defined “In-Scope” is by default “Out-of-Scope”, including (but not limited to) the items listed in the Program Scope section as Out-of-Scope.
Testing is only authorized on the targets listed as In-Scope. If you believe you've identified a vulnerability on a system outside the scope, please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com before submitting. 
The following finding types are specifically excluded from the bounty:

Broken client-side access control mechanisms. While always helpful and appreciated to be reported on, client-side mechanisms generally run in an environment that is out of our control. For example, the client-side restriction of accessing the export functionality is not blocking users from manually exporting credentials. Since credentials are already available encrypted but exclusively on the client side, we can't restrict that from server side. 
Attacks targeting jailbroken or rooted mobile devices. Users are explicitly notified about the security concerns of installing LastPass on such a device. 
Links that are indexed by Google and/or url scan sites.  Sometimes these links can affect customer data but only for a short period of time.  These can appear due to manual scans done by users or by virus scanners and may stay indexed for a period of time.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) not being necessary for page load autofill from loading the user’s local offline cache.  If the user’s account settings permit offline access for 2FA and if the user has previously logged into the machine, offline mode will override 2FA and allow the web browser to run page load autofill.  This will not happen if the login is done on a new device.

Attacks against endpoints which enable username enumeration or brute forcing of credentials (for example login forms) when those endpoints already have reasonable rate limits in place. Distributed attacks using multiple IP addresses are also excluded. 
WebView related issues in our in-app browser on Android and iOS. We are greatly limited by the platform and most of these bugs are bugs in the WebView itself. If you find an issue with our implementation/usage and there is a reasonable way to fix it, we may consider it. 
Memory dumps or issues found by tools that read active or cached memory. Performing such an attack would require an already compromised system and a malicious actor with escalated privileges. Once such an attack can be performed on a system, there is no way in principle to protect other processes running on that system. 
Attacks performed by a malicious application or browser extension installed on the system, as there is usually no way to protect against them on desktop platforms. On mobile we accept issues exploited by apps with limited privileges (e.g. if an app without any special permission could read the unencrypted passwords, that would typically be in scope). 
Insider threats. We have processes against internal attackers that are regularly audited by external parties (we are SOC2 Type II compliant), so these attacks are excluded from this program. 
Denial of service, spam, or phishing attacks. These attacks are considered abusive and can harm our customers.

Limitations around sharing which are documented on our website. Sharing has technical limitations so please check the description of explicitly mentioned ones on.
Attacks that rely on/have as a prerequisite successfully placing a man in the middle between our servers and the client. We take precautions in order to make these attacks difficult or infeasible (e.g. using HTTPS exclusively), but some aspects are out of our control and thereby excluded from eligibility.

“Missing” security practices without a realistic attack scenario (e.g. missing HTTP headers, missing certificate pinning) or in general questioning design decisions. While we are always evaluating and make reasonable efforts to consider security standards and emerging “best” practices, we expect that your submission contains a descriptive attack scenario with real impact to our users, as opposed to recommendations based on emerging, novel, or unnecessary practices. 

Please ensure your submission describes a realistic attack scenario that could present a risk to our users and/or their data, even if the scenario includes something that is considered out of scope, as noted above. In that case, we will consider the submission to be eligible for the Bugcrowd bounty.

OWASP CSRFGuard,https://bugcrowd.com/owaspcrsfguard,"


OWASP supports many volunteers efforts to produce security libraries which at the same time are used by many companies and developers, in order to secure their applications. This bounty program for CRSFGuard run by OWASP is to determine the protection level claimed by the library and verify that indeed the protected application is not vulnerable to CRSF attacks when using the library.
Rewards
OWASP may provide rewards to eligible reporters of qualifying vulnerabilities. 
About OWASP CSRFGuard
The OWASP CSRFGuard library is integrated through the use of a JavaEE Filter and exposes various automated and manual ways to integrate per-session or pseudo-per-request tokens into HTML.

OWASP CSRFGuard implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks. In order to implement this pattern, CSRFGuard must offer the capability to place the CSRF prevention token within the HTML produced by the protected web application. CSRFGuard 3 provides developers more fine grain control over the injection of the token. Developers can inject the token in their HTML using either dynamic JavaScript DOM manipulation or a JSP tag library. CSRFGuard no longer intercepts and modifies the HttpServletResponse object as was done in previous releases. The currently available token injection strategies are designed to make the integration of CSRFGuard more feasible and scalable within current enterprise web applications. Developers are encouraged to make use of both the JavaScript DOM Manipulation and the JSP tag library strategies for a complete token injection strategy. The JavaScript DOM Manipulation strategy is ideal as it is automated and requires minimal effort on behalf of the developer. In the event the JavaScript solution is insufficient within a particular application context, developers should leverage the JSP tag library. The purpose of this article is to describe the token injection strategies offered by OWASP CSRFGuard 3.

About the OWASP HTML Sanitizer Project
The OWASP HTML Sanitizer is a fast and easy to configure HTML Sanitizer written in Java which lets you include HTML authored by third-parties in your web application while protecting against XSS. The existing dependencies are on guava and JSR 305. The other jars are only needed by the test suite. The JSR 305 dependency is a compile-only dependency, only needed for annotations. This code was written with security best practices in mind, has an extensive test suite, and has undergone adversarial security review. A great place to get started using the OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer is here: https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md.

SecureDrop,https://bugcrowd.com/freedomofpress,"


SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from and communicate with anonymous sources. It is currently a project of Freedom of the Press Foundation and was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz.
SecureDrop aims to help parties communicate securely by using a number of privacy enhancing tools, including Tor, Tails, QubesOS and GPG. The system runs on dedicated hardware and is isolated from the media organization's corporate network with a dedicated network firewall.
SecureDrop provides two web interfaces, both of which are only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network; one that sources use to send messages or upload documents, and one that journalists use to check submitted information and reply to sources. All communication happens over the Tor network, and submissions are encrypted at rest with GPG. Either Tails on an air-gapped computer or QubesOS is used when reviewing the information submitted.
We appreciate all security concerns brought forth and are constantly striving to keep on top of the latest threats. Being proactive rather than reactive to emerging security issues is a fundamental belief at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. We appreciate the community's efforts in creating a more secure ecosystem.

Bugcrowd,https://bugcrowd.com/bugcrowd,"


Bugcrowd orchestrates the creativity of the crowd to solve some of cybersecurity's toughest challenges. Our own security is our highest priority.
If you think you’ve found a security vulnerability in our systems, we invite you to report it to us via our platform. We commit to working with you to get it assessed and handled appropriately, and offer cash rewards for valid, unique vulnerability reports.
This program is for reporting potential security vulnerabilities only. If you want to report a functional bug, require assistance with a submission, or have a general question, please visit our contact page.
We’ve set up a bounty on the Bugcrowd platform called Hack Me!, where you’re welcome to hack as if on a customer’s bounty. Please do not ever test against a real customer’s bounty. As stated in our code of conduct, disruptive testing which affects other Researchers’ access to the testing environment, or adversely impacts a customer’s systems and/or accounts is prohibited. 
Our bounty program adheres strictly to Bugcrowd’s Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy – a collaborative, community-driven effort to classify common security vulnerabilities and identify baseline severity ratings based on real findings across hundreds of bug bounty programs. Before submitting your vulnerability, consult the VRT to determine its severity and whether it may be eligible for a reward. Vulnerabilities with a P5 baseline rating according to the VRT are generally not eligible for a bounty. If you’d like to make a suggestion to improve the VRT, you can create an issue on GitHub.
Bonuses
When presented with especially interesting High (P2) or Critical (P1) Priority vulnerabilities – especially if our internal knowledge allows us to identify a much greater impact than what an outside researcher's proof-of-concept may have suggested on its own – we may choose to award an additional bonus amount of up to 100% of the initial reward suggested by our priority guidelines. Such bonuses are always at our discretion.
