Registrar.gov: Bug Bounty Program,https://bugcrowd.com/registrar-dotgov,"


Verisign Responsible Disclosure Program Terms:
We appreciate security researchers who help us keep Verisign employees and systems secure by reporting vulnerabilities in our services or infrastructure. Researchers who report such vulnerabilities may receive monetary bounties subject to the terms and conditions outlined below. To qualify for a bounty, researchers must meet the following requirements:

You must adhere to our Responsible Disclosure Policy (see below). 
Your report must address one of the in-scope Targets listed under “Bug Bounty Program Scope"" and must identify an eligible vulnerability (see below).
We specifically exclude certain targets as out-of-scope and certain security issues as ineligible (see below). 
You should provide sufficient proof of the vulnerability, such as a written description of the vulnerability or a screenshot demonstrating its existence. 
You agree to convey any and all intellectual property rights arising from or relating to each vulnerability you provide under Verisign's Program Brief. 
If you inadvertently access account data, service configurations, or other confidential information (collectively “Data"") while investigating an issue, you are prohibited from saving, storing, transferring or otherwise further accessing any and all such Data after discovery.

In turn, we follow these guidelines when evaluating reports under our bug bounty program:

We investigate all reports and respond to all reports relating to in-scope targets and eligible vulnerabilities. Due to the volume of reports we receive, we prioritize evaluations based on risk and other factors, and it may take some time before you receive a reply. 
We determine bounty amounts based on a variety of factors, including (but not limited to) impact, ease of exploitation, and quality of the report. You can find further information in our Rewards Guidelines below. 
We generally pay similar amounts for similar issues, but bounty amounts and qualifying issues may change over time. Past rewards do not necessarily guarantee similar results in the future. 
In the event of duplicate reports addressing the same vulnerability, we award a bounty to the first person to report an issue with sufficient proof.
We reserve the right to publish reports (and accompanying updates). 
We may post a list of researchers who have submitted valid security reports. If you receive a bounty for discovery of a vulnerability, you are eligible to be included in this list, but you may opt not to be included if you wish. We reserve the right to limit or modify the information accompanying your name in the list. 
[Bugcrowd] verifies that all bounty awards are permitted by applicable laws, including (but not limited to) US trade sanctions and economic restrictions.
Verisign employees and their immediate family are not eligible to participate. 

Verisign Responsible Disclosure Policy:
Verisign expressly authorizes researching and reporting security issues in a manner that complies with the policies below, and, Verisign will not initiate a lawsuit against you or seek any law enforcement investigation against you in response to such authorized research and reports. We require that:

You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others. You specifically should avoid unauthorized access to, or destruction of, data and interruption or degradation of our services.
You do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason. Impermissible exploitation includes, but is not limited to, actions intended to demonstrate the potential impact or risk of the vulnerability, such as attempts to compromise sensitive company data or probing for additional issues related to an eligible vulnerability in an in-scope target that exceeds any of the policies addressed here. 
You do not intentionally violate any applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized access to data.

You are not authorized to access user data or company data, including (but not limited to) personally identifiable information or other data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. If you inadvertently access personal or company data while investigating an issue, you are prohibited from saving, storing, transferring or otherwise further accessing any and all such data after discovery.
Bug Bounty Program Scope:
Below is a list of in-scope and out-of-scope servers and websites, and a list of eligible and ineligible vulnerabilities to help guide your research. If you are unsure whether a service or vulnerability will qualify you for a bounty or not, feel free to ask support@bugcrowd.com.

ThousandEyes Bug Bounty,https://bugcrowd.com/thousandeyes-og,"


The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. ThousandEyes gives organizations visibility into the now borderless network, arming them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their applications, users, and customers.

This program adheres to the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy for the prioritization/rating of findings.
Guidelines:

Please note that this is a live, production environment.
Automated vulnerability scans are strictly prohibited (this includes any kind of brute-force enumeration).
Keep information about any vulnerabilities you have discovered confidential between yourself and ThousandEyes. Any disclosure without prior approval is grounds for removal from the program, and forfeiture of any reward.
You must ensure that service operation and integrity and confidentiality of customer data are not affected in any way as a result of your testing. Any form of Denial of Service testing is strictly prohibited. If you believe you have identified a vector by which DoS can be performed, please reach out to USSR@thousandeyes.com.
This is a Private Program, so you must not discuss program details including Program name, scope, Vulnerability details, bounty structure, account information, or any other detail to anyone who is not a Bugcrowd employee or member of this program. When collaborating with other Finders on the Program, be sure to do so in a secure manner, in accordance with disclosure requirements listed in Bugcrowd’s Code of Conduct.
Please ensure that the string “Bugcrowd-<BugcrowdUsername>” is appended to your user agent for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic before performing any testing. Example instructions on how to modify the user agent string for Chrome can be found here and for Burp Suite can be found here.

2.Once your ICP wallet address is ready, reply to this email and send the email address you plan to associate your account with before starting the KYC process. The provided email address will be whitelisted on the KYC website (~3 working days).
3.You will receive an email notification once your email has been whitelisted. Submit your KYC application on the KYC DFINITY page by clicking on ‘Other’ and entering the email address you provided to receive a unique link to begin the verification process. The KYC will be performed by a 3rd party and all information that the DFINITY Foundation receives is the email address and the ICP address.  
Make sure at every stage of the onboarding process that your wallet address and associated email address are entered correctly to avoid any delay. As a reminder, DFINITY is not responsible for your asset custody nor will it be held accountable for any loss of your ICP distributed to you in the ICP wallet address you have provided.
If you have any questions regarding your KYC application or obtaining your ICP wallet address, please contact DFINITY Support.

CyberGhost,https://bugcrowd.com/cyberghost,"


CyberGhost operates thousands of VPN servers and makes cross-platform VPN applications for all major desktop and mobile operating systems as well as routers and browser extensions.
CyberGhost takes the security of its applications and services seriously. We've offered an in-house bug bounty program for years and paid out thousands of dollars to security researchers in that time. We value excellent engineering and are always looking for ways to improve the security of our products and services.
Scope
Please ensure that your activities remain in-scope to the program. For example, admin panels for data center services we utilize are out of scope because they are not owned, hosted, and operated by CyberGhost. If you are unsure if your testing is considered in-scope please reach out to support@bugcrowd.com to confirm first. A researcher found to be testing out of scope will be ineligible for a reward and we will reserve the right to immediately remove the individual from the program.
Ratings/Rewards:
For the initial prioritization/rating of findings, this program will use the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy. However, it is important to note that in some cases a vulnerability priority will be modified due to its likelihood or impact. In any instance where an issue is downgraded, a full, detailed explanation will be provided to the researcher - along with the opportunity to appeal, and make a case for a higher priority.
We will review coordinated disclosures on a case by case basis. However, please note that we will automatically reject any findings that are marked as duplicates or not applicable. Please do not submit a disclosure request if your submission fits into these categories.

You Need a Budget (YNAB),https://bugcrowd.com/ynab,"


We work hard to keep You Need a Budget secure, and make every effort to keep on top of the latest threats by working with security researchers and companies. If you think we've made a security mistake or have a vulnerability, please tell us right away. If you're the first to alert us and it leads to us making a change, we'll pay you a reward.
Our Philosophy:

We're on your side! We both want you to find bugs in our application before any bad guys do.
Please be a hacker, but don't be a jerk. We'll get into more examples later, but that means: Hack your own accounts, not someone else's accounts. Don't perform DoS or DDoS attacks. Don't try to break into our physical offices or do anything illegal. Don't waste our time. This program is an invitation to test our systems. It's not an invitation to be a bad person.

What we hope you find:
(Actually, we hope you can't find any of this, but you know what we mean.)
The objective is to discover vulnerabilities in our web application and API.
Of particular interest are:

Bugs that Allow reading or writing of another user's data
XSS bugs
Bugs that Leak Sensitive information between sessions
Issues that affect Authentication or Session Management
Anything else classified P1-P3 really gets our attention!

How we classify submissions:
We classify all submissions based on Bugcrowds Vulnerability Taxonomy. P1s are scary, and we pay the maximum for those. On the other hand, P5s are considered ""recommended practices"", and we intentionally don't follow all recommendations. However, if you submit a P5 and we change our code as a result of your submission, it will be bumped to a P4, and paid out accordingly. 
Note: Please don't pretend your issue is more severe than it is when describing it. It will lead to lost trust and higher frustration, but it never leads to higher payouts!
